According to the affidavit, the armorer had taken the spent casing out of the gun. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/affidavit-offers-new-details-on-baldwin-shooting-that-killed-cinematographer/article_73bc2302-334d-11ec-b2b6-6f5fe3cd1edd.html">https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/affidavit-offers-new-details-on-baldwin-shooting-that-killed-cinematographer/article_73bc2302-334d-11ec-b2b6-6f5fe3cd1edd.html</a><br /><br />Normally, the process begins with an armorer bringing the gun to the director or assistant director to show nothing is inside, he said. Then it is brought to the actor with the assistant director, who often shines a light through it to show an empty barrel and chamber.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/warrant-cameraman-said-baldwin-was-careful-with-firearms/article_5d264f60-35a4-11ec-a9c4-d78d9bcd051c.html">https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/warrant-cameraman-said-baldwin-was-careful-with-firearms/article_5d264f60-35a4-11ec-a9c4-d78d9bcd051c.html</a><br /><br />Gutierrez Reed’s lawyer Jason Bowles said in a statement Wednesday that “we are convinced this was sabotage and Hannah is being framed.
