{% raw %}i live for that creepy voice dennis makes when he starts talking about some random psychopathic fantasy so here's a compilation i made<br /><br />This video is fair use under U.S. copyright law because it is (1) non-commercial, (2) transformative in nature, (3) uses no more of the original work than necessary for the video's purpose, and (4) does not compete with the original work and could have no negative affect on its market.{% endraw %}
