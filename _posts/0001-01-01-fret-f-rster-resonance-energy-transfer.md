{% raw %}Hey Scientists,<br /><br />today I present you a way to detect protein-protein interactions using FRET (Förster Resonance Energy Transfer). If you have some additional question coming up after watching this video, just write them in the comments and we can discuss it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Henrik<br /><br />Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/king_henrik_the_1st/">https://www.instagram.com/king_henrik_the_1st/</a>{% endraw %}
