{% raw %}Listen to Eric Edwards' compelling analysis of success versus significance, and how he came to realize the value in each.<br /><br />Eric Edwards “tried unsuccessfully to get out of Richmond his entire life” only to realize that this city was the perfect place for education, innovation, and to raise a family. For the last 15 years, he has been blessed to be surrounded by extraordinary people dedicated to developing potentially life-saving products. Eric, and his twin brother, Evan, co-founded Kaléo (formerly Intelliject) after growing up with life-threatening allergies to a variety of foods and medicines, realizing there was a need for products that were built from the patient’s perspective. Kaléo – which is ancient Greek meaning “to have a calling or purpose” – is driven to make a positive difference in the lives of patients, in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as in the lives of our communities and families.<br /><br /><br /><br />Eric is passionate about medical missions, entrepreneurship, and the potential for our youth to make a significant impact in this world. He lives in Midlothian with his supportive wife, Autum, and three loving children, ages 8, 6 and 4.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
