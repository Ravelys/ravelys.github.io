{% raw %}Families come in a lot of different sizes and combinations. A family may have one parent/guardian or multiple parents/guardians, and may be a chosen or given family. A family may also consist of friends and loved ones who provide care, affection, and help meet the needs of those within the family unit. Your family may look and function very differently from the families of your friends, and thatâ€™s ok. There are no right or wrong ways in which a family should look.{% endraw %}
