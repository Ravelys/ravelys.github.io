{% raw %}Yakko Warner from the TV show Animaniacs singing a song to help you learn the Nations of the World. <br /><br />I loved watching this show when I was a kid and I loved this song, but I always wished I had the lyrics so I decided to do a video and add them on. I hope you like it!<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
