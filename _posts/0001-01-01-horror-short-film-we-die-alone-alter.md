{% raw %}A chance encounter dangerously intertwines the lives of three people with differing perspectives on love.<br /><br />Subscribe to ALTER on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/LnXRC3">https://goo.gl/LnXRC3</a><br /><br />#ALTER #horror #shortfilm<br /><br />More About WE DIE ALONE: Aidan, a young man crippled by loneliness and insecurity, wants nothing more than to experience love, but he compulsively ghosts any connections he makes through dating sites. Aidan's co-worker Elaine, generous with her advice and kindness to a fault, encourages him to put himself out there -- although, in her heart of hearts, she wishes he would pick up on her feelings for him.<br /><br />Everything changes when Chelsea, beautiful and distant, moves into the apartment across the hall from Aidan's. The two feel an instant connection based on their refusal to engage in social norms, and bond over an unusual hobby. This chance encounter throws Aidan into a spiral of dangerous infatuation that will alter all three of their lives.<br /><br />Touching on themes of loneliness, obsession, and the brutal nature of relationships, We Die Alone assesses the aftermath of what happens when three isolated people with different ideas of love become dangerously intertwined.<br /><br />Director - Marc Cartwright <br />Produced by - Marc Cartwright &amp; Baker Chase Powell <br />Cassie Keet - Screenplay<br />Executive Producer - Sharon Ekstrom<br />Line Producer - Alex Ferrari <br />Assistant Director - Nicholas GIanforti<br />David Williams - Music <br />Gabriel Gely - Cinematography <br />John Garaguso - Production Designer <br />Jennifer Treadwell &amp; Monica Kelly - Casting <br />Hair and Makeup - Stephen Bowman<br /><br />CAST<br />Baker Chase Powell - Aidan <br />Ashley Jones - Elaine <br />Samantha Boscarino - Chelsea <br /><br />About ALTER:<br />The most provocative minds in horror bring you three new short films every week exploring the human condition through warped and uncanny perspectives. <br /> <br />Be ready to leave the world you know behind and subscribe.
