You see, it’s all about creating a strong base of your child so that he turns out to be a good citizen of his country. <br /><br />Now, as a parent, you’d definitely know what laws are, why you need to follow them and what are your responsibilities towards your country but teaching what you know to your child can be a little daunting because these little ones are new to these things and they are curious so they might end up questioning you a lot. <br /><br />The point is that there are certain things you need to do to teach your kids about the laws, rights, and responsibilities, etc. You can make them watch different Youtube videos, you can use textbooks and the best way to teach your kids about their rights and responsibilities is to come up with different stories that have a moral in the end. You see, kids love listening to stories and this is what you can use to teach them about their country. <br /><br />Your kid should know that a law is basically a code of conduct that a country follows and every citizen is supposed to follow that code of conduct. Your kid should know that he has certain responsibilities towards his nation and he should also know his rights as a citizen. Teaching your kids all of this is imperative if you really want him to grow into a responsible person. <br /><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr">https://goo.gl/iG2Bdr</a><br /><br />#TalentedAndGifted #LearnWithKidsAcademy<br /><br />Kids Academy Talented and Gifted Program for kids aged 2-10: <br /><br />*****<br /><br />Connect with us on :<br /><br />App Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8">https://smart.link/59833db06a6b8</a><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smart.link/597210af6eb83">https://smart.link/597210af6eb83</a><br /><br />Our website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kidsacademy.mobi">http://www.kidsacademy.mobi</a><br />Facebook:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...">https://www.facebook.com/KidsAcademyC...</a><br />Twitter:           <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo">https://twitter.com/KidsAcademyCo</a>{% endraw %}
