Join us as we explore the diversity of historical experiences and conceptual representations of co-operatives. These concepts have been built into an opensource curriculum known as the COOP4EDU project funded by the EU, and in this webinar we will dive into the module on history developed by the team of the Centre of expertise for co-operative entrepreneurship of KU Leuven, Belgium. It will allow you to get familiar with founding ideas, leaders of co-operative movement, as well as with factors of institutionalization of co-operatives in Europe, and understanding how European experiences contributed to further development of the co-operatives in other regions of the world.<br /><br /><br />Speaker:<br />Dr. Nazik Beishenaly is a postdoctoral researcher at KU Leuven, and a Research Advisor at the International Cooperative Alliance.
