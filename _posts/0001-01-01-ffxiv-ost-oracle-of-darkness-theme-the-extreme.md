{% raw %}spoilers ahead lol<br /><br />Includes the transition + clear pov, the latter of which is taken from my stream so there's a noticeable drop in quality, sorry. During editing I forgot to raise the levels once I was done with everything so it came out a bit more quiet than I wanted it to, my bad on that. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xThrGBg08U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xThrGBg08U</a> for a bandaid fix.<br /><br />FINAL FANTASY is a registered trademark of Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd.<br />FINAL FANTASY XIV Â© 2010-2020 SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD.
