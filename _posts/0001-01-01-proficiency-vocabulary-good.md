Tanscript: <br />The other day I was out with my bestie and she told me she had bought tickets for some kind of concert. Now, at first I wasn't really keen on the idea of a concert, you know, in a real concert hall and everything...But then, I guess she perduaded me because she talked about a very virtuous and young pianist and she told me that he was exemplary at solo performances. So, I said, &quot; Why not? Let's try it out! &quot;. And... a few days later we find ourselves waiting outside the concert hall, at the theatre. So...it was a very nice place, it was a delightful atmosphere. The ambience was brilliant. Everything (was) decorated with fine furniture and fine garments. So, it was a really exciting place to be in anyway. Then the concert started. We had a great time I must admit. What I didn't expect, though, was that the pianist wasn't...you know... when you close your eyes and think of a pianist or generally an artist, you think of a delicate and thin person, but he was quite robust. He was..so.. he was a sturdy man and he was very tall. Yeah, I might say he was a bit vigorous in his manner which was a positive thng, I guess. His performance was absolutely great. Ayway I enjoyed it and my bestie did too. Then I've been thinking...Actually, I've been thinking since then, I've been thinking...erm... fine arts is a very beneficial thing to come in contact to..like..sufficient exposure to fine arts is a benevolent thing for my life and, I guess, also for a child's developement..so.. I wish we'd all had access to all concerts for free. Though, I'm not sure if that (is) ever goonna happen. But well...{% endraw %}
