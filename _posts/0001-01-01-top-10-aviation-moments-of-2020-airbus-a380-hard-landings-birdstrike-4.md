{% raw %}At least for planespotters 2020 was a fantastic aviation year. Lots of unusual and rare airplanes showed up at various airports on special cargo flights. In this video I would like to show you my personal Top 10 Aviation highlights of year 2020 and I am going to say a few things to each step. <br /><br /><br />The Airbus A380 of All Nippon Airways departed on a test flight from Hamburg Finkenwerder to Hamburg Finkenwerder and I spent a night at Hamburg just to film it. Around 300 planespotters witnessed the departure of the All Nippon A380 testflight that day.<br /><br /><br />I was also able to film a Boeing 747 Classic in 2020. Unbelievable! 8 years after I saw my last classic Boeing 747 Geo Sky suddenly reactivated a B747-200 Freighter and they operated a few mask charter flights from China to Maastricht.<br /><br /><br />I also included the beautfiul Ilyushin IL62, the Antonov An22, a hard Airbus A300 landing and many more interesting aviation moments of 2020. I hope you enjoyed this video, new videos every tuesday and friday.{% endraw %}
