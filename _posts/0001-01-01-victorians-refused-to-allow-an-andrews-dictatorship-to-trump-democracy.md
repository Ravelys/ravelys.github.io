{% raw %}Sky News host Peta Credlin says Victorians refused to allow an Andrews “dictatorship” to “trump democracy” at protests against proposed new pandemic laws over the weekend. <br /><br />Ms Credlin said Saturday afternoon’s protests against the Andrews government’s proposed pandemic bill attracted people from “all walks of life” and “political affiliations”. <br /><br />“Ordinary Victorians, many of who have never protested before, but who said over and over again, that these laws were a tipping point for them, and they couldn't stay silent any longer,” she said. <br /><br />“To me, it was the moment, when Melbourne got some of its self-respect back.<br /><br />“Honestly, after the humiliation of going from most liveable city in the world to the most locked down, it was as though ordinary citizens said enough, not in my name.”{% endraw %}
