This tells us how much of a company’s net income goes to dividends. If the ratio is negative, or above 100, this means money is likely being borrowed to pay shareholders dividends – not a good sign if you’re relying on consistent dividends to pay your bills. <br /><br />Third is the company’s history of dividend payments. While the past is never a guarantee of the future, we can be more confident that the stock with a track record will continue to deliver… especially if the management can show us that dividends are a consistent part of their financial strategy.<br /><br />Fourth, it’s important to look at the value a company provides. This helps us determine if a company is likely to perform well in the coming years. <br /><br /><br />One more thing – even though dividends are a form of passive income, they aren’t risk-free, and choosing to invest in a company with a higher dividend yield is generally more risky…<br /><br />It’s widely accepted that between 3% to 5% per year is a good range to work with if you intend to use your dividends to cover your monthly expenses…<br /><br />There are some dividend stocks that exceed those limits, with those you just need to be careful.<br /><br />You want to see a company using its income to both increase its competitiveness in the market and also reward investors for their commitment. <br /><br />Don’t assume that a higher dividend yield means that it’s a better stock; some companies will pay high dividends to make up for lackluster stock price movements or other operational issues…<br /><br />These issues can make the company less profitable in the years to come, leaving you holding the bag .<br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/">https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Schedule one-on-one business consulting with me here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://max-maher.teachable.com/p/1hr-consultation-call">https://max-maher.teachable.com/p/1hr-consultation-call</a><br /><br />*I am not a financial advisor.
