{% raw %}Track #7 of Jeff Loomis's 2008 album Zero Order Phase<br /><br /><br /><br />Zero Order Phase is the debut solo album by Nevermore's guitarist Jeff Loomis. It was released on September 30, 2008 through Century Media Records. The album was produced by Neil Kernon, and features guest appearances of guitarists Ron Jarzombek, Pat O'Brien, and the jazz bassist Michael Manring. Zero Order Phase, which is all instrumental album, was recorded at the famous Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington, during March 2008, and in addition to Loomis on guitar and bass, had the ex-Nevermore member Mark Arrington on drums<br /><br /><br /><br />In an interview, Jeff Loomis explained that the album was being written after the end of This Godless Endeavor tour, a year ago.[1] Loomis wrote two months before starting production.[1] Zero Order Phase was recorded during a month and a half, at the Robert Lang Studios in Richmond Beach, Washington, with production of Neil Kernon, and featuring the former Nevermore drummer, Mark Arrington.[2] The choice of Neil Kernon to produce the album has been several years ago while both—Jeff Loomis and Neil Kernon—were working on the third Nevermore album, Dreaming Neon Black, Loomis spoke to Kernon that &quot;if I ever did a solo project he would produce it.&quot;[1] During the recordings Loomis commented about the album's production, saying: &quot;Being able to do this entire recording with Neil [Kernon] is really amazing as well. We've done some great work in the past, but being able to focus on an entire instrumental record is going to be great&quot;.[3]<br /><br /><br /><br />The album also featuring several guest appearances, Ron Jarzombek, who splits solos with Loomis on &quot;Jato Unit&quot;, Cannibal Corpse's guitarist Pat O'Brien on &quot;Race Against Disaster&quot;, the jazz bassist and solo musician Michael Manring on &quot;Cashmere Shiv&quot;, along with producer Neil Kernon playing a fretless guitar solo on the same track.[4] In a interview to Komodo Rock, Loomis explains that because the guest musicians lived in different parts of the United States, he e-mailed copies of the rhythm guitar and drums. The guest musicians recorded their solos at their own home studios and sent the tracks back to him in Seattle [5]<br /><br /><br /><br />[edit] Critical reception<br /><br />Zero Order Phase was described as &quot;a good instrumental guitar CD&quot; by About.com reviewer Chad Bowar. He also praised Loomis stating: &quot;excellent guitar skills [...] technical riffs, creative solos and nonstep shredding&quot;.[6] Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth.net pointed the album as &quot;one goddamned fiery tribute to the instrumental shred lords that have inspired his [Jeff Loomis] playing&quot;.[7]<br /><br /><br /><br />Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic wrote: &quot;guitarist Jeff Loomis has unearthed the instrumental guitar hero template that was briefly made popular by Joe Satriani in the late '80s and early '90s,&quot;[8] he also stated that &quot;tracks like 'Shouting Fire at a Funeral,' 'Jato Unit,' and 'Devil Theory' are entrenched in the metallic music ingredients he [Jeff Loomis] is renowned for.&quot;[8] 'Azure Haze' and 'Sacristy', were defined as &quot;sweeping ballads&quot;; on the last one, Loomis was again compared with Joe Satriani, Rivadavia stated: &quot;admittedly very Satriani-esque.&quot;[8]<br /><br /><br /><br />[edit] Track listing<br /><br />All music composed by Jeff Loomis.<br /><br /><br /><br />No. Title Length <br /><br />1. &quot;Shouting Fire at a Funeral&quot;   4:54 <br /><br />2. &quot;Opulent Maelstrom&quot;   6:07 <br /><br />3. &quot;Jato Unit&quot;   4:41 <br /><br />4. &quot;Azure Haze&quot;   4:59 <br /><br />5. &quot;Cashmere Shiv&quot;   6:16 <br /><br />6. &quot;Race Against Disaster&quot;   6:13 <br /><br />7. &quot;Sacristy&quot;   4:50 <br /><br />8. &quot;Devil Theory&quot;   6:16 <br /><br />9. &quot;Miles of Machines&quot;   5:45 <br /><br />10. &quot;Departure&quot;   3:56 <br /><br />11. &quot;Omega's Influence&quot; (Japanese Bonus Track) 5:01 <br /><br />Century Media Records<br /><br /><br /><br />[edit] Personnel<br /><br />Jeff Loomis -- bass, guitar, keyboards, programming<br /><br />Neil Kernon -- keyboards, programming, producer, engineer, string arrangements, mixing, fretless guitar solo on &quot;Cashmere Shiv&quot;<br /><br />Mark Arrington -- drums, percussion<br /><br />Ron Jarzombek -- guitar solo on &quot;Jato Unit&quot;<br /><br />Pat O'Brien -- guitar solo on &quot;Race Against Disaster&quot;<br /><br />Michael Manring -- bass on &quot;Cashmere Shiv&quot;<br /><br />Alan Douches -- mastering<br /><br />Brian Valentino -- assistant engineer<br /><br />Stephanie Cabral -- photography{% endraw %}
