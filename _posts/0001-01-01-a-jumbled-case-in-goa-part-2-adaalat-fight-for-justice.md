All the doors are shut. When the prosecution has prepared a water tight open and shut case where even a blind man can tell that the accused is guilty. But no one can see the case from the angle KD does.  He digs fervently for loopholes in the prosecution’s case much to their frustration and thinking on his feet, he manages to turn the entire case around. Let's see what happens next. Stay tuned.<br /><br />About The Show:<br />-----------------------------<br />Adaalat is a show revolving around KD Pathak, a  suave, sophisticated, witty, and yet unconventional lawyer who is known as a 'Houdini' in circles of law because he can get his clients out of the tightest of situations. His success rate of acquittals is 100 percent. But most importantly KD stands not for his client, but for Justice. Lawyer K.D. Pathak takes up the challenge of defending the accused by personally investigating the crime.{% endraw %}
