{% raw %}The White House believes vaccine requirements for large private companies are still weeks away from being implemented, weeks after President Joe Biden announced the new mandates were coming.<br /><br />During a press briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration hopes to have &quot;more detail&quot; on the regulations &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot;<br /><br />Asked if this signaled a delay in their rollout, Psaki said it didn't, and that an exact timeline had never been given.<br /><br />&quot;Maybe we should have been more specific at the time,&quot; she said. &quot;Obviously it takes some time and we want to make sure when we put these out, they're clear, and they provide guidance necessary to businesses.&quot;<br /><br />Earlier this month, Biden announced stringent new vaccine rules for federal workers, large employers and health care staff in a sweeping attempt to contain the latest surge of Covid-19.<br /><br />Join your host Sean Reynolds, owner of Summit Properties NW, and Reynolds &amp; Kline Appraisal as he takes a look at this developing topic.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/vaccine-requirements-biden-administration/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/politics/vaccine-requirements-biden-administration/index.html</a><br /><br />🔔Join this channel to get access to perks 👇<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHm8vWol8eNjTJZSjq2jaLQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHm8vWol8eNjTJZSjq2jaLQ/join</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />🔥🔥 𝑺𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒕𝒍𝒆 𝑹𝒆𝒂𝒍 𝑬𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝑷𝒐𝒅𝒄𝒂𝒔𝒕 🔥🔥<br /><br />►💎iTUNES<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2MkFziJ">https://apple.co/2MkFziJ</a><br /><br />►💎SPOTIFY<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2Dh8EoL">https://spoti.fi/2Dh8EoL</a><br /><br />►🏡JOIN SUMMIT PROPERTIES NW<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://summitpropertiesnw.com/career/">https://summitpropertiesnw.com/career/</a><br />High 80/20 Split, Zero Fees, and a Low $10,000 Cap!<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />✔ SUBSCRIBE 📣HIT BELL! ✔LIKE ✔COMMENT<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />★ REACH OUT TO ME ★<br /><br />►✅Follow Us - Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/summitpropertiesnw/">https://facebook.com/summitpropertiesnw/</a><br /><br />►✅Follow Us - Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/summitpropertiesnw/">https://instagram.com/summitpropertiesnw/</a><br /><br />►✅Email Me - sean@seattlerealestatepodcast.com<br /><br />#SeattleRealEstate #HousingMarket #Podcast{% endraw %}
