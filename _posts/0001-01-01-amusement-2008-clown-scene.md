{% raw %}Amusement is a 2008 American horror film directed by John Simpson and starring Katheryn Winnick, Laura Breckenridge and Jessica Lucas. The film went direct-to-video in January 2009. It was the last film to be distributed by Picturehouse Entertainment before their closure in 2008 and relaunch in 2013.<br /><br />It's a film that takes different urban legends and intertwines them to an overarching story. One of the creepiest scenes in the film involves Tabitha and what appears to be a life-size clown statue, which is an urban legend I'd discovered years ago that still disturbs me to this day.{% endraw %}
