{% raw %}Are you finding it hard to promote your blog? Well, there's an easy solution for that. Today I'm going to breakdown how to promote your blog's content when nothing's working.<br /><br />RESOURCES &amp; LINKS: <br />____________________________________________<br />Hello Bar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hellobar.com/">https://www.hellobar.com/</a><br />OptinMonster: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://optinmonster.com/">https://optinmonster.com/</a><br />subscribers.com: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://subscribers.com/">https://subscribers.com/</a><br />Ubersuggest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/">https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/</a><br />____________________________________________<br /><br />Nearly 40% of marketers say content marketing is a very important part of their overall marketing strategy according to HubSpot. The best way to promote your content is through omnichannel marketing. 94% of marketers use social media or content distribution, according to SEMrush. <br /><br />Now, question for you is, when you promote your content on social media, how many channels are actually promoting your content? Is it just one like Facebook, or is it two, three, four? <br /><br />List out how many channels you're using and the social networks you're promoting on. For example, I put all my content on Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter. Those are the main social channels that I'm posting my content, those are five. <br /><br />For each channel, what are the specific types of content that work better than others? And I'm going to break down, you know, five tips that you can do right now to promote your content, but you need to keep in mind, what does better on some networks versus others. <br /><br />Now I'm going to tell you some of this but, as you're browsing these networks, you just need to keep those things in mind. <br /><br />So on Instagram, reels and stories, and IGTV are the best type of posts that get more love from Instagram. <br /><br />Number two, LinkedIn. Video content does really well, long-form text-based posts do really well especially ones that are thought provoking, that are asking questions and inviting engagement. <br /><br />Three, Facebook. Paid ads are the best way to promote your content on Facebook. Hate to say it, but it's true. Organic stuff doesn't do as well. <br /><br />Four, email marketing. Every time I release a blog post, I send out an email blast. I do it twice a week, sometimes three times a week, but that's my process, works really well. You can use tools like Hello Bar, or OptinMonster to collect emails. <br /><br />Five, push notifications. Every time I release a new post, I send out a push notification through subscribers.com. It's a great way to get traffic. <br /><br />And lastly, as a general rule of thumb, when you're linking to your content from social media, I would create social content that supports or directly relates to your blog content. Then have call to actions and invite people to check out your blog content. That way people are engaging on those social platforms and then they're much more likely to go onto your blog. <br /><br />Now here's another bonus tip for you. Before you create content to figure out, hey, I'm going to go create this content, promote it on social, you may already have your channels that you want to promote. <br /><br />But before you go create your content, I want you to go to Ubersuggest and typing keywords related to that content. When you go to Ubersuggest and you type in a keyword in the left hand navigation, there's this report called content ideas. This shows you all the popular pieces of content around the web related to that keyword based on social shares like Facebook or based on social shares, like Pinterest. <br /><br />And that'll tell you what's working. So then that way you're writing content for all the channels and you won't just get the short-term traffic, but you also get the long-term traffic. Social email blast is more short-term, long-term is more SEO.<br /><br /><br />► If you need help growing your business check out my ad agency Neil Patel Digital @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://neilpateldigital.com/">https://neilpateldigital.com/</a> <br /><br />►Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ScRTwc">https://goo.gl/ScRTwc</a> to learn more secret SEO tips.<br />►Find me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/">https://www.facebook.com/neilkpatel/</a><br />►On Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/neilpatel/">https://instagram.com/neilpatel/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#SEO #ContentMarketing #DigitalMarketing{% endraw %}
