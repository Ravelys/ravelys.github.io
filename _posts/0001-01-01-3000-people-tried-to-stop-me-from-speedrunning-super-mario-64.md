{% raw %}Super Mario 64 has been modded so that my viewers on Twitch can control the world of SM64. How far can I get until someone messes everything up?<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64/tits-4-bits-prod-giovanni">https://soundcloud.com/simply64/tits-4-bits-prod-giovanni</a><br /><br />Simply speedruns Super Mario 64, while using the sm64 crowd rom hack mod. This Mario 64 mod can be a pain, because of Twitch viewers can set mario on fire or make mario fly. The frame of comedy russel during OTK gameday kickball was also painful. OTK gameday kickball with Mizkif, Emiru, Alinity, and nmplol was good. Simply was MVP for that. Maybe he'll get another award if he gets the SM64 120 Star World Record like liam, batora, and cheese speedrunning. Emiru mizkif mario race challenge will be interesting. Should Simply teach Emiru how to speedrun SM64 so that Emiru takes one of Mizkif's boxes? That would be funny.{% endraw %}
