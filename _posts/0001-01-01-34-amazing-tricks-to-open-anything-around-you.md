{% raw %}CRAZY BUT COOL TRICKS FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY <br /><br />Experiments with magnets are the best ones! They are not only used around the home but also perfect subjects for simple science experiments. The first experiment is incredibly easy and cool! Place three glasses in a row and fill the first one with water, the second one with vegetable oil and the third one with syrup. Place several paper clips in each glass. Place a piece of glass over the glasses and take a magnet and place over each glass. Check out how differently paper clips move. Have you ever seen ferrofluid? You can make this experiment using two simple ingredients: vegetable oil and printer ink. In a bowl, mix printer ink with a small amount of vegetable oil and stir. Take a magnet and hold it close to the liquid and watch how the liquid is attracted to it. Watch the video till the end and you will find magic tricks with rubber bands, ropes, and playing cards! Moreover, this video is full of tutorials on how to tie various knots. Knots could save your life and even if you live in a big city you should know basic knots. Besides, knots also could be used in many practical ways at home or even at work. For example, you can hang pots or terrariums with succulents to decorate your apartment. As a bonus, you will find a collection of money tricks that you can use to entertain your friends during the party! My favorite magic trick is how to make a money printer. Yes, it sounds crafzy but this project is really cool! <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />00:09 Experiments with magnets <br />01:18 Ferrofluid experiment <br />03:09 Magic tricks with ropes <br />06:18 Different kinds of knots <br />09:41 Crazy money tricks <br />11:24 DIY Money printer<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/">https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/">https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/5m_crafts">https://twitter.com/5m_crafts</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fWbJqz">https://goo.gl/fWbJqz</a><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PEuLVt">https://goo.gl/PEuLVt</a><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2S69VUG">http://bit.ly/2S69VUG</a><br /><br />The Bright Side of Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me">http://www.brightside.me</a><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a> This video is made for entertainment purposes.
