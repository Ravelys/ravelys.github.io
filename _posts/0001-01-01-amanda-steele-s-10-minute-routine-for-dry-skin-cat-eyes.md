She also explains why she starts her whole look with creams and sets with powders later in her routine. <br /><br />Still haven’t subscribed to Allure on YouTube? ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AllureYouTubeSub">http://bit.ly/AllureYouTubeSub</a><br /><br />Sign up for our monthly Allure Beauty Box ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3itsPmG">https://bit.ly/3itsPmG</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT ALLURE<br /><br />The best daily makeup tips, skin-care advice, hair tutorials, product reviews, and videos from beauty experts. <br /><br /><br /><br />Amanda Steele's 10 Minute Routine for Dry Skin &amp; Cat Eyes{% endraw %}
