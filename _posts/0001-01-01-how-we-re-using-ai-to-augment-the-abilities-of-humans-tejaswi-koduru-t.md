{% raw %}Using a phone app to identify tickborne diseases sounds futuristic, but high school student Teja has made this a reality. Inspired by a mysterious bug bite in his childhood, Teja taught himself the principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through free online courses, then used what he learned to develop a mobile app that can accurately detect the difference between a &quot;bullseye&quot; rash and similar-looking bites to speed the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme Disease. Teja Koduru is a sophomore at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. He has experience in using AI to diagnose diseases in their early stages. His research paper, titled “Using Deep Learning in Lyme Disease Diagnosis'', was recently accepted to an international research conference. He is also the director of Avs Academy Center for Excellence, where he helps students with projects relating to machine learning. In his free time, he likes to volunteer and has received the Presidential Service Award several times for his efforts. He looks forward to exploring the possible uses of AI in healthcare. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
