{% raw %}Advanced English Grammar Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.espressoenglish.net/advanced-english-grammar-course/">https://www.espressoenglish.net/advanced-english-grammar-course/</a><br /><br />We use depend and depending when one thing is strongly affected by another thing.<br /><br />However, a lot of students are confused about when to use depend vs. depending. You'll learn exactly when to use each one in today's lesson.<br /><br />There are a lot of little details in English grammar, and I think the best way to master it is NOT ONLY to study... BUT ALSO to practice!<br /><br />You can do both - study and practice - inside my Advanced English Grammar Course.<br /><br />Each of the 45 lessons has clear explanations of the grammar topics, plus quizzes and writing exercises to help you use the grammar yourself.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.espressoenglish.net/advanced-english-grammar-course/">https://www.espressoenglish.net/advanced-english-grammar-course/</a>{% endraw %}
