{% raw %}Check out the NEW Math Game we made at   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MageMath.com/">https://www.MageMath.com/</a> <br />It is a full video game called Mage Math that helps kids build confidence in math while having tons of fun.  <br /><br />In this video we talk about more and fewer. The video gives the students a visual way to see when there are more or fewer objects. This lesson goes great with objects to use right after the video. As students get their hands on objects and learn the difference between more and fewer it will relate to them easier.<br /><br />Kindergarten students will love the video so please share it.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our math and learning videos are designed to help with the education of children in this important growing phase. The videos teach math and other subjects that help children in their education. We make videos for toddlers, preschool, kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade, 3rd grade and even a few for 4th grade. It is our goal to help kids achieve their potential by giving them a head start in math and other areas of education.<br /><br />Please Subscribe and Share the videos.<br /><br />You can also join us on<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.commoncore4kids.com/">https://www.commoncore4kids.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mathvids4kids.com/">https://www.mathvids4kids.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/commoncore4kids/">https://www.pinterest.com/commoncore4kids/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Common-Core-4-Kids/414329405248165">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Common-Core-4-Kids/414329405248165</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jasoncore4kids">https://twitter.com/jasoncore4kids</a>{% endraw %}
