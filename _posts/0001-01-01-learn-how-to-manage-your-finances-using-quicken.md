{% raw %}There just isn’t any way around it. No matter how you earn, invest, slice, dice and spend your money, one financial fundamental will hold true: you have to track your finances to achieve and maintain financial success. It’s the plain and simple truth.<br /><br />Quicken is the best way to do this in my opinion. It has the most features and it's something you can grow into as your financial picture gets more complicated. I've been using it for 20 years.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playlouder.com/reco/plsite/quickenpc">https://www.playlouder.com/reco/plsite/quickenpc</a><br /><br />I also offer both free and paid courses, all about personal finances and mapping your way to financial freedom (of which personal bookkeeping plays a big part). You can learn more about those here...<br /><br />Free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playlouder.com/courses/personal-budgeting-basics-free/">https://www.playlouder.com/courses/personal-budgeting-basics-free/</a><br /><br />Paid: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playlouder.com/courses/the-financial-independence-roadmap/">https://www.playlouder.com/courses/the-financial-independence-roadmap/</a><br /><br /><br />#finance #financemanagement ##financemanagementsoftware #financemanagementsystem #personalfinance #smallbusiness #business #debtfree #debtfreejourney #personalfinanceblog #moneymanagement #financeindependence #entrepreneur #financialfreedom #investing #investment #realestate #sucess #wealth #financialliteracy #realtor #tradelines #credittips #dept #smartspendinghabits #smartspending #clearancefinds #smarmoney #smartspending #consciousspending <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video and description may contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I’ll receive a commission.
