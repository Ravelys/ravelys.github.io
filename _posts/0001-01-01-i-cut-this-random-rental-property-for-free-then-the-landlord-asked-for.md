{% raw %}I would like to thank you for supporting the channel and a lot of people said that they would like to help me with monetary compensation but I would ask that instead of helping me, if you could donate to help Kyra Mcdonald whos 3 year son (Aybel) is in need of a possible Liver transplant after his recent fight with hepatoblastoma Cancer. He has received chemo treatments which have gone well but his current prognosis is around 60% chance of survival. If you are unable to give through financial support it would mean the world if you could just copy and paste the gofundme link to your favorite social media platform. By doing this together we can help her to take care of her Child through this time of need. Aybel is a feisty young boy that I have had the pleasure to meet and I look forward to seeing him make it through this and grow to be a strong young man. <br /><br />Thank you so much for your love, kindness and support. <br /><br />Aybels gofundme link --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gofund.me/ab7edcd5">https://gofund.me/ab7edcd5</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JxtbUj98bZc">https://youtu.be/JxtbUj98bZc</a> song at 16 min <br />------------------------------------------------<br />Juggernaut Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kevinhansen_juggernaut/">https://www.instagram.com/kevinhansen_juggernaut/</a><br />------------------------------------------------<br />Lawn Care Juggernaut Facebook Group - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2146585178918790/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2146585178918790/</a><br />-----------------------------------------------<br />Mailing address for Lawn Care Juggernaut Channel<br />P.O.
