He became galvanized, however, by the love of fellow Cambridge student, Jane Wilde, and he went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children.  Over the course of their marriage as Stephenâ€™s body collapsed and his academic renown soared, fault lines were exposed that tested the lineaments of their relationship and dramatically altered the course of both of their lives.<br /><br />The Theory Of Everything Official Trailer{% endraw %}
