{% raw %}It took me a while but I finally did it. My old record of 10 mins 27 is beaten. The only down side is that I didn't break 10 minutes, which let's face it I could have easily done had I been a bit sharper. <br />On the plus side, the 10 minute barrier is still up for grabs. <br /><br />Subscribe to the channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
