{% raw %}This is my in depth review of Deadside, I talk about the games mechanics from raiding, PvP, PvE, and everything in between. In this review I walk through the mechanics of the game in the shoes of a new player, talking about mechanics as they pop us, as well as potential issues. <br /><br />This video was made primarily for the Deadside Steam Store page, but I figured I would upload it on YT for the people looking for the full video, or for anybody else looking for a review.<br /><br />Check out the stream! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/loafds">https://www.twitch.tv/loafds</a><br /><br />Come play on my Deadside server!
