{% raw %}We visited the Charter Fair in the center of Ilkeston and what a great evening we had, Rides everywhere you turn and really good rides too, I got to try the local delicacy of Mushy Peas and Mint Sauce ðŸ¤¢ which the boys were not impressed with but we got to ride some brilliant rides like Tip Top, Hollands Extreme, Stargate, Music Tagada, Atmos Fear, X Treme, 2 brilliant Waltzers, plus much more. Such a brilliant street fair you will not run out of rides as there were so many we only scratched the surface. The Charter Fair is on in ilkeston till Saturday and is well worth visiting.{% endraw %}
