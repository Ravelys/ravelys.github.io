{% raw %}A real hurricane hit Moscow on October 22, 2021. The wind blew with gusts of up to 20 meters per second attacked not only the outskirts, but also hit the very heart of the capital - the Kremlin. See how easily a raging hurricane demolishes the scaffolding installed at the Kremlin wall. All this happened in front of numerous passers-by. It's good that no one was hurt. The hurricane easily picks up and demolishes almost all light and loose structures. The wind in some districts of Moscow began to carry away garbage cans and fell trees. One of them fell onto the playground. Several more trees landed on parked cars.<br />In 2021, natural disasters have become more frequent. We are seeing climate change in many countries around the world. It is not known how 2021 will end.<br /> #weather #news #earthquake #rain #tornado #wave #Moscow #storm #flood #fire #Kremlin #volcano #hurricane #Russia #disasters <br />The channel lists natural disasters, such as: 1) Geological emergencies: earthquake, volcanic eruption, mud, landslide, landslide, avalanche; 2) Emergency hydrological situations: tsunami, limnological disaster, flood; 3) Fires: forest fire, peat fire; 4) Meteorological emergencies: Tornado, Cyclone, Blizzard, Hail, Drought, Tornado, Hail, Hurricane, Tsunami, Storm, Thunderstorm, Storm. <br />NATURAL DISASTERS playlist <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t6yKoc2R6U&amp;list=PLJDMRqT6RYJiJ9r4jIyqVGmx2OZ7l3oRO">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t6yKoc2R6U&amp;list=PLJDMRqT6RYJiJ9r4jIyqVGmx2OZ7l3oRO</a>{% endraw %}
