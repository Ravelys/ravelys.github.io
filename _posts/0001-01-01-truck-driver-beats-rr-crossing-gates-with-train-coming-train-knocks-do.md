{% raw %}Train coming so how does this truck driver beat the train?!  Watch the train knock down the signal!  Historic Railroad Signals!  Baltimore And Ohio Railroad signals still in use!  CSX train with a DPU going through downtown Troy, Ohio on the CSX main line.   The unusual railway crossing in the first scene is only a block from the RR crossing in the second scene.  By now everyone knows what a DPU is and what is meant by &quot;knocking down the signal&quot;.  Right?  Okay, well a DPU is a distributed power unit that is controlled by the engineer in the leading units and the DPU locomotives can be mid train, shoving on the rear or anywhere.  When a train knocks down the signal, it means that the signal went from green to red as the train went past it.  Back to the first train.  The train was southbound heading toward Cincinnati.  In order to not have to wait for the train, the truck just went around the gate to the left since there was no traffic and the slow train was way back.   It's not as bad as it looks.  It's nothing like the truck that I filmed that bent the crossing gate into the path of the approaching  train.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANyCdvB5m_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANyCdvB5m_I</a> The second scene in this video is really cool!  The mixed freight with the mid train DPU goes past the old B&amp;O signals and we get to see them work.  These signals are becoming rare.  Most of them have been replaced and very few are still in use.  I want to film as many as I can while they are still here.  Leave a comment below if you know where some are that are still in use.  I found some on the Logan Branch in West Virginia that I plan on filming soon.  They are ex Chesapeake And Ohio Railroad.  This video was filmed in Troy, Ohio, which is just north of Dayton.  CSX uses 160.230 .   How many cars were on the trains?  Leave a comment below telling me how fast the trains were going and how many cars were on each train.   The combine was harvesting soy beans on the farm across the road from me.   Filmed November 4, 2021 CE.  Thanks for watching!
