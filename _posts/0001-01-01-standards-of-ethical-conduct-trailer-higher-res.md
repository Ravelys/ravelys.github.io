{% raw %}For those who work in big corporations, the antics that occur at FCT, a recently acquired subsidiary of URBM, will be all too familiar.  In &quot;Standards of Ethical Conduct&quot;, you'll follow the story of Heff, a cubicle-dweller who finds himself in conflict with FCT's nightmarish code of conduct after an unfortunate incident at the annual company Halloween party. Last Comic Standing semi-finalist Chuck Roy co-stars as Heff's stoner roommate, a man pursuing a very different sort of American Dream. If you like an office comedy like &quot;Office Space&quot; or an office show like &quot;The Office&quot;, you'll dig this.{% endraw %}
