{% raw %}&quot;Knight Rider. A shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Michael Knight: a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law.&quot;<br /><br />Those words have a powerful meaning, especially because it comes from one of the greatest shows from the 1980s, Knight Rider.<br /><br />I grew up with the show, and still love it to this day. So I decided to create a number of Knight rider intros. So sit back, relax and enjoy the first video in the series.<br /><br />I had to start with the original theme and the intro. The original introduction was so mysterious, and is quite well known for KITT zooming into the camera (or away from the camera for that matter). <br /><br />So here it is: classic knight rider clips, the original theme from the original show (originally composed by Stu Phillips and updated by Don Peake) and that famous voiceover (By Richard Baseheart, who plays Wilton Knight in the Pilot).<br /><br />Enjoy! <br /><br />--Milestones--<br />04/03/20 - WOW! I've always been around on Youtube, just not uploading videos. So when I checked out this my Knight Rider intro has got over 12 Million Views! Words cannot express my gratitude. So Thank You! I would high five you all, but that will take time...<br /><br /><br />27/09/10 - My humble Knight Rider Intro, has now got nearly 2 Million views! Man, that is a lot isn't it? THANK YOU SO MUCH! for everyone who has viewed this video. I greatly appreciate it :D<br />14/12/10 - My Video has now got over a million views! <br /><br />23/02/10 - 200,000 + views <br /><br />26/11/09 - 50,000 views! thanks everyone!<br /><br />Thank you for everyone who has took an interest in my video. When I first created it, I was hoping it would get the views it deserved, considering how much time and effort I put into making it. Thank you!{% endraw %}
