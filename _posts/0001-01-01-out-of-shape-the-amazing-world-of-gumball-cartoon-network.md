The BAFTA award-winning series tells the story of an extra-ordinary suburban family who just happen to live in an ordinary town. Along with Gumball and Darwin there's Dad, a 6'4&quot; pink rabbit who stays at home while Mom works in the rainbow factory and Anais, a 4-year-old genius bunny. This season will bring to light to some tough questions such as; will Gumball ever win the affections of Penny? How will Darwin react when Banana Joe chews up his pen? And what happens when Gumball and Darwin get their first cell phone? All will be answered, well maybe not answered, but it sure will be entertaining to watch.<br /><br />►  Click to watch more of The Amazing World of Gumball - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkhjQtWfYUDwXAXpnFOv6M_epAJz4TPgr">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkhjQtWfYUDwXAXpnFOv6M_epAJz4TPgr</a><br /><br />► Click to watch the best of Gumball - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77ED97B132C66551">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77ED97B132C66551</a><br /><br />#TheAmazingWorldofGumball #TAWOG #Gumball #Darwin #Carrie #Penny #TheWattersons #NicoleWatterson #RichardWatterson #GumballWatterson #DarwinWatterson #Elmore #GumballandDarwin #DarwinsYearbook{% endraw %}
