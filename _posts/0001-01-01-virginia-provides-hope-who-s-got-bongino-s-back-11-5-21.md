{% raw %}Steve and the crew are joined by New York talk show host Shannon Joy for the Deace Group to discuss a hopeful outlook after the results of the Virginia election. The panel also discusses the story of conservative superstar talk show host Dan Bongino and his fight against Cumulus Media's vaccine mandate. In Hour Two, it's another edition of Feedback Friday.<br /><br />Steve Deace barely made it out of community college in one piece, and then loosely attended a real college for a while. The Steve Deace Show serves up principled conservatism with a snarky twist every weekday from 12-2 PM ET on BlazeTV.<br /><br />► Click HERE to subscribe to BlazeTV on Youtube! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KJHuwu">https://bit.ly/2KJHuwu</a><br /><br />►Click HERE to join BlazeTV! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://get.blazetv.com/">https://get.blazetv.com/</a><br /><br />► JOIN our NEWSLETTER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theblaze.com/newsletters">https://theblaze.com/newsletters</a><br /><br />Connect with Steve on Social Media: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow">http://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/SteveDeace">http://facebook.com/SteveDeace</a>{% endraw %}
