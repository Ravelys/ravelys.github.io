{% raw %}Tuberculosis is the biggest killer amongst all infectious diseases. Being from a small farm in East Germany, Andreas grew up believing that tuberculosis is a disease that mainly affects cattle. After studying microbiology and immunology he now devotes his time understanding the disease and working on the global effort to develop vaccines against tuberculosis, to potentially save millions of lives.  Andreas is an NHMRC CJ Martin Research Fellow within the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine at James Cook University, Cairns. Andreas completed his masterâ€™s degree in biology at Humboldt-University in Berlin. He undertook his PhD research at the University of Melbourne and his postdoctoral training at the Max-Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Germany as an NHMRC Fellow. His interests include microbiology, immunology and infectious disease epidemiology. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
