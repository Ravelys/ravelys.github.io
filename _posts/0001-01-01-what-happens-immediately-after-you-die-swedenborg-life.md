While obtaining his degree in communication studies from Oakland University, Curtis experienced an internal battle with depression that led him to question God and his lifelong interest in Swedenborgian theology. After a period of intense suffering, he recovered from his depression with the help of modern medicine, therapy, and a return to the spiritually uplifting messages he found in Swedenborg’s writings. Now, Curtis is applying his education and desire to help others find peace through Swedenborg’s insights by producing and hosting this weekly webcast.<br /> <br />Rev. Dr. Jonathan S. Rose is the series editor of the New Century Edition, an ongoing project that incorporates the latest scholarship to produce a modern, accessible translation of Emanuel Swedenborg’s theological works. Holder of a B.A. and a M.Div. in religion and a M.A. and a Ph.D. in Latin, he has worked for years in the study of Neo-Latin and in Swedenborgian research. He was both chaplain and a tenured professor of religion and sacred languages at Bryn Athyn College before taking on his current position with the Swedenborg Foundation.<br /><br />Karin Childs is a scriptwriter and online moderator for offTheLeftEye. Her spiritual growth is largely informed by a lifelong Swedenborgian education. While raising five children with her husband, Jon, she applied her love of the Bible and Swedenborg's writings to volunteer work, creating Sunday school programs and church pageants. It was Swedenborg's works that Karin turned to for solace after the devastating death of their oldest daughter. For 17 years, she and Jon ran a small Swedenborgian publishing company to help others dealing with loss and grief, and wrote three novels herself. Now, Karin puts her compassion into action through the work of the Swedenborg Foundation. <br /> <br />Chelsea Odhner is a production manager and scriptwriter for offTheLeftEye. A lifelong Swedenborgian, Chelsea's interest in Swedenborg's spiritual work intensified in her early twenties when she realized she wanted to make conscious changes in her life and behaviors. When paired with her study of yoga practice and philosophy, Chelsea found Swedenborg’s worldview connected all the spokes of different faiths and philosophical perspectives that she values. Initially interested in pursuing a career in integrative medicine, her passion for poetry, writing, and music led her to focus on serving the spiritual side of health and well-being.<br /> <br />★☆★REACH OUT★☆★<br /> <br />Want to be a featured guest on our show or have an offTheLeftEye team member appear on your show?
