The Backloop allows you to prevent spinal degeneration from starting, because it induces motion into the spine and its discs. Using the Backloop as directed decompresses the spine because of the pumping action of the discs, (similar to a traditional decompression traction table) as shown on the youtube video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube/CF4U3OOi77o">http://youtube/CF4U3OOi77o</a> .......An inversion table which simply stretches the spinal muscles, ligaments and discs, without the pumping action, is not performing decompression. If it did they would have live action video fluoroscopy demo on video! Spinal decompression helps everyone by improving flexibility and posture. The Backloop is only 4 lbs. and installs in 1 minute, and treatments only take a few minutes a day.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/mybackloop">http://www.facebook.com/mybackloop</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/mybackloop">http://www.twitter.com/mybackloop</a><br /><br />Â© Copyright 2014 N &amp; T Healthcare Enterprises, LLC.
