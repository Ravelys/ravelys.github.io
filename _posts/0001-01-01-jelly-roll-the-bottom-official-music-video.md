He sees his music as therapeutic, not just for him, but for anyone who comes in contact with it.As genuine a modern day outlaw as you can get, Jelly's music incorporates influences ranging from Southern Rock to Dirty South rap. With his latest album, A Beautiful Disaster, Jelly Roll draws you in with his ability to tell a story that you didn't even know you were a part of. With songs like &quot;Creature&quot;, &quot;I Need You&quot;, &quot;Nothing Left At All&quot; and the dark, haunting love story &quot;Suicide&quot; along with features from the likes of Tech N9ne, Struggle Jennings, Krizz Kaliko and Lil Wyte, A Beautiful Disaster gives you a direct link to the life of Jelly Roll - the trials and tribulations, along with the celebrations and victories.{% endraw %}
