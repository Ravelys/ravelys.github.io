However, once you dispose or sell your stock then you generate a taxable event and will be subject to capital gains taxes.<br /> <br />You want to know whether you're dealing with long-term capital gains, in other words, assets that you've held for a year or longer, or short-term as the tax rates differ. You also want to consider whether we're dealing with a tax advantage account and that's why it's important to work with a professional who will help you determine the most efficient way to report and pay taxes on these capital gains.{% endraw %}
