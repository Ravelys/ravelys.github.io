{% raw %}“I WANT” covers several important themes including a young man's quest for love and the steps he takes to pursue it. These themes range from his fame to his wealth to the numerous interactions he has with multiple characters in his journey. Chris uses the song to talk about his 'somewhat' successful journey through the dating scene and how he has been able to surmount all the obstacles. The song also alludes to a common Kenyan playground rhyme &quot;I Want I Want&quot; that carries nostalgic memories for the artist and his audience.<br /><br />Connect with Chris Kaiga:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chris_kaiga">https://www.instagram.com/chris_kaiga</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chris_kaiga">https://twitter.com/chris_kaiga</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chris.kaiga">https://www.facebook.com/chris.kaiga</a><br /><br />Production Company: Wunder Pictures<br />Director: Frnck<br />DOP: Brian Rop<br />Audio Producer: Manch!ld<br />Audio Engineer: Ashi Akatsa<br />Makeup Artist: Carole Gathoni &amp; House of Tway<br />Stylist: Luca<br />Asst.
