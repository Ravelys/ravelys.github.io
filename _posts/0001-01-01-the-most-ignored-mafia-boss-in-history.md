{% raw %}For the past century, the Hollywood movie industry has painted a picture of the Mafia. The common story is that the mob, also known as &quot;The Commission&quot; ran the country from Chicago and NYC. This is a lie. There was a third region that was just as important as Chicago and NYC, and was CRUCIAL to the operations in NYC. <br /><br />The original Commission, also known as La Cosa Nostra. Was created by Lucky Luciano. He created a commission of organized crime bosses, the original bosses were 4 bosses from NYC, Joseph Bonanno, Tommy Gagliano, Vincent Mangano and Joseph Profaci. The 5th boss was the infamous Al Capone in Chicago.  The 6th boss was Stefano Magaddino, known as the Buffalo mafia boss, who actually lived in and operated out of Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls, NY used to be primarily Sicilian. Most people have heard of Lucky Luciano, Al Capone and maybe Joe Bonanno. Some people have heard of Joe Profaci, Vincent Mangano and Tommy Gagliano..  However almost no one has ever heard of Stefano Magaddino... <br /><br />1. Stefano Magaddino was the longest running Boss in mafia history ever. <br />2. He was never sent to prison, he was never assassinated.<br />3. He organized the meeting at Appalachin, NY. <br />4. The 5 families used him as an external mediator when they had disputes. <br />5. He was related by blood to Joe Bonanno. <br />6. He owned a funeral home where it is rumored he cremated the remains of mafia murder victims. <br />7. He was a member of the &quot;Good Killers&quot;, an assassin squad that paved the way for Murder Inc. <br /><br />Yet, his name and legacy has been completely scrubbed from the history books, and the Hollywood movie industry buried his story completely. <br /><br />This is the story of Stefano Magaddino, the most ignored Mafia Boss in History...{% endraw %}
