{% raw %}Alternate title: Jango's Peanut Gallery<br /><br />This took me too long, as I had to pretty much watch most of the movie to find lines that could be, &quot;possiblyfied.&quot; It's similar to style to a genre called, &quot;YouTube p**p,&quot; but the fundamentals of this and that are totally different. YT P is about no content at all, while this is about rhythm with commentary.<br /><br />From what I could get from Wikipedia, some of Morrision's lines of the, &quot;Jango's Apartment,&quot; scene sound so suspicious and terribly lying (as what is supposed to be happening in the scene) partly because of his New Zealand accent. In response to some questions, some kinds of NZ accents will have a response with rising inflecting at the end of the answer. Although this is not found in the signature, &quot;possibly,&quot; or in, &quot;one or twice,&quot; it may be heard in, &quot;I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe,&quot; but this is uncertain.{% endraw %}
