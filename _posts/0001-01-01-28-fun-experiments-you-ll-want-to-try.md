{% raw %}Science is so much fun! And we have the experiments to prove it. Today’s video is all about exciting science experiments that will entertain you for hours and teach so many things about chemical reactions, viscosity, magnetic properties,  temperature, and more. So grab your goggles and your test tubes, and let’s get started! Our first experiment uses a lemon, copper clips, and steel nails to turn on a small light bulb.<br /><br />Then, we’ll teach you how to create natural dyes using vegetables, fruits, and boiling water. We have a really cool experiment involving magnetism that you just have to see to believe. You’ll need soda cans, coins, and a magnet. You’ll also see an experiment that shows the effect of fluid viscosity on magnetic properties. You’ll need 3 fluids of different viscosity: water, oil, and syrup. Keep watching for a cold water vs. warm water experiment and more!<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />0:41 – Electric lemon<br />2:35 – Natural dyes with fruit and veggies<br />6:33 – Spinning magnetic coins<br />8:32 – Fluid viscosity and magnetism<br />10:28 – Marker spider race<br />11:30 – Cold water vs. warm water<br /><br />We advise adult supervision and care at all times.<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
