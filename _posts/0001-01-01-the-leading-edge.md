{% raw %}A documentary telling the story of the formation and operation of the Marlboro Aerobatic Team. Pilots Philip Meeson, Nigel Lamb, Ian Peacocke and Dick Manning show us their aerobatic expertise in the unrivalled Pitts Special and Extra 230 aerobatic planes. The programme includes interviews with the pilots, giving an in-depth view of these extreme machines and the dedication required to fly them. Narrated by Barry Foster, recorded in 1986.<br />I once had the privilege of being taken for a demonstration flight in the S-2 (2-seater)  version of this plane, and of being handed control by Philip Meeson himself. An UNforgettable experience! Thank you Philip. (Rob Hermans){% endraw %}
