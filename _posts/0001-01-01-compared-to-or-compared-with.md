[NEXT]<br /><br />Compared with is usually used when the difference between two things is more important than the similarities. In biomedical science, we’re often comparing two items to note any differences between them – drugs, enzymes, equipment …<br /><br />So: Compared with drug X, drug Y is more effective in improving 5-year survival in patients with disease Z. [NEXT SLIDE]<br /><br />However, the difference can be quite subtle…<br /><br />Take the statement: Compared with drug X, drug Y is associated with a greater increase in serum creatinine. <br />i.e. there is a difference between the two.  [NEXT]<br /><br />But compare this with the statement: Compared to drug X, drug Y is also associated with raised serum creatinine. <br />In this case, these drugs have something in common and ‘compared ‘to’ is more appropriate. [NEXT]<br /><br />Well, I hope that’s helpful.
