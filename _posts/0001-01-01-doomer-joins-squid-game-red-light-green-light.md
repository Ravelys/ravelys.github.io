{% raw %}This meme video is about Doomer joining the Squid Game game &quot;red light green light&quot;. In Bogdanoff terms &quot;pump it, dump it&quot;. While waiting for his train, Wojak gets to play a crypto game with chad which he eventually wins. He then gets invited to Squid Game because he's a wage slave and deserves an opportunity to leave the wage live. Wojak indeed escapes the wage life, but by following a different path then the squid game makers intended. <br /><br />Any feedback on my videos is welcome in the comments! I’m a new kid on the block who likes making doomer, boomer, zoomer etc. memes, and it would be epic if one day I can become as great as Bizonacci, Dustin O’daffer or MillenniaThinker. Your feedback really helps me in improving my meme animations.<br /><br />Follow me:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lowbudgetstoriesyt/?hl=nl">https://www.instagram.com/lowbudgetstoriesyt/?hl=nl</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lowbudgetstory">https://twitter.com/lowbudgetstory</a><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LowBudgetStories">https://www.reddit.com/user/LowBudgetStories</a><br /><br />Music by Audionautix.com{% endraw %}
