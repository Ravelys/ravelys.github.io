{% raw %}What is Credit Rating?<br /><br />A credit rating is an assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower. Individuals, corporations and governments are assigned credit ratings — whoever wants to borrow money.<br /><br />What about the Credit Score?<br /><br />Individuals who want to borrow money are given ‘credit scores’, while corporations and governments receive ‘credit ratings’.<br /><br />Why are the Credit Ratings so important?<br /><br />National governments, not countries, are assigned credit ratings by agencies like Standard &amp; Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. Governments require ratings to borrow money.<br /><br />A country requests a credit rating agency to evaluate its economic and political environment and arrive at a rating. This is done to position itself as a destination for foreign direct investment.{% endraw %}
