{% raw %}China’s Belt and Road Initiative “will be surpassed” by their “cheap, totally clean power from space”, says Australia’s first astronaut Dr Paul Scully-Power. <br /><br />Dr Scully-Power told Sky News host Alan Jones the communist power is positioned to become the major supplier of solar energy to the world.  <br /><br />He said while China has plans to send up satellites to produce space-based solar power the technology is currently in the testing phase. <br /><br />“They're doing ground tests from balloons back down to earth to test it out,” he said.{% endraw %}
