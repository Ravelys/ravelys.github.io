{% raw %}Hey everyone, today we’re going to be reworking five killer perks that have been somewhat forgotten, largely due to low usage and questionable power. The idea of this is to suggest changes that’ll get the perks usage up, but not necessarily make it rival the best perks in the game, just up it to a good standard whilst also making it a bit more fun. If you’ve got a good idea for any of these perks and how they could be changed, please do drop it down below. Let’s get into it. <br /><br />Chapter XXI is a Hellraiser one! The DLC is currently out and features the new killer, The Cenobite, or Pinhead. This is, however, the only content that seems to be releasing with the chapter.<br /><br />Music used from YouTube Audio Library: <br />The Emperor's Army - Jeremy Blake <br />Clean and Dance - An Jone<br /><br />Hope you enjoy! <br />Follow me on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AZHYMOVS">https://twitter.com/AZHYMOVS</a> <br /><br />Dead by Daylight Wiki (very helpful and a ton of cool stuff and secrets on there): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki">https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki</a> <br /><br />Timestamps:<br />Intro 0:00<br />Furtive Chase 0:24<br />Hoarder 2:49<br />Hangman's Trick 4:30<br />Dead Man's Switch 6:08<br />Hex: Blood Favor 8:28<br />Outro 10:09{% endraw %}
