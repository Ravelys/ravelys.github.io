{% raw %}These unexplained pictures will leave scratching your head.<br />Subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/9CwQhg">http://goo.gl/9CwQhg</a><br /><br />A picture is said to be worth a thousand words, though fact versus fable can be difficult to determine when evidence is limited and theories run wild. Stories associated with these images are not easy to explain or even not at all probable. Since the beginning of time, man has bared witness to the strange and unexplainable. With no cameras or smartphones to capture these moments, the ancients would scribe what they saw on stone. Lucky for us, today we have the technology to see things that the human eye does not. For example...<br />A father takes a photo of his daughter one afternoon while the two were together outside and no one else around. When the picture is developed, you can clearly see a man in a space suit standing a few feet behind the little girl. Where did he come from? <br />What about the mysterious old lady seen calmly taking photographs of the chaos that proceeded the gunshots that fateful day in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, when John F. Kennedy was assassinated? There are pictures to prove her presence but no records of her existence...intrigued yet?<br />See mind boggling images that even the most skeptical of the skeptics may have a hard time disputing. Everything from the mysterious death of Elisa Lam, pyramids on the moon, sea monsters to unidentified flying objects hovering around our planets atmosphere, are all captured. Check out the video and see for yourself.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheRichest.org">https://www.facebook.com/TheRichest.org</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheRichest_Com">https://twitter.com/TheRichest_Com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/therichest">http://instagram.com/therichest</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Featuring:<br />Babushka Lady<br />Hessdalen Lights<br />Hook Island Sea Monster<br />Solway Firth Spaceman<br />S.S.
