{% raw %}Hey guys. It's Halloween week so I've decided to start this game that's impossible to describe but a lot of fun to play. The core mechanics are a CCG Roguelike, but you're also playing as the guy who's playing cards. You can get up and try and escape the room that you're trapped in while being forced to play the card game against your captor who will murder you or something if you lose. It's a trip! It's made by the same guy as Pony Island if you remember that old gem. Self aware video games that make you feel uncomfortable seem to be their bread and butter. I hope you enjoy!<br /><br />you can find the game, among others, available on my nexus store which helps me keep the lights on:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nexus.gg/Janet/inscryption">https://www.nexus.gg/Janet/inscryption</a><br /><br />Join the Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/gWVydDQ">https://discord.gg/gWVydDQ</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JanetOnOccasion">https://twitter.com/JanetOnOccasion</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/JanetOnOccasion">https://www.patreon.com/JanetOnOccasion</a><br /><br />Or you can become a member through Youtube:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbuDbg7DTogK7NYA0UsgrQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbuDbg7DTogK7NYA0UsgrQ/join</a><br /><br />Some of you might prefer to watch my Livestreams on Twitch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/janetonoccasion">https://www.twitch.tv/janetonoccasion</a><br /><br />For business you can use my email address:<br />JanetOnOccasion@gmail.com<br /><br />Have a good day, guys.<br /><br />The outro music is a excerpt from the cover of &quot;King Of The Rodeo - Kings of Leon&quot; by a fine subscriber of mine that goes by the name of David McMichael.
