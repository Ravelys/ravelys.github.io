{% raw %}Here is a complete shelter with a real fireplace and waterproof roof! A great shelter and one of my best shelters to survive in the woods! Friends this shelter, is exactly the shelter that you needed to survive!  In this shelter I usually use dead wood and clay also part of a metal barrel that I just found in the woods! The way to make this shelter belongs totally to me with the traditional and material means found in place. I still have to finish the interior the finishes. At the moment I am in difficult conditions there are eating in the woods I show you in the other episodes with my adventures in the woods.. My little fireplace is really great, amazing warmth. Take a good look at how to make this shelter because it can save your life! <br />Thank you very much to all for your comments and likes and for your support. <br /><br />Sincerely Athos<br /><br />#bushcraft #shelter #survival{% endraw %}
