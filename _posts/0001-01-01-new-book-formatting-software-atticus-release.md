{% raw %}Check out Atticus here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Atticus.io">https://Atticus.io</a><br /><br />Atticus.io is a new book writing and formatting tool that helps authors to write and format professional books with ease.  Unlike Vellum, Atticus works on all computers and is even $100 cheaper.  <br /><br />You can use the writing section to reorder chapters, have a clean aesthetic canvas to write in, and use key tools and capabilities to write the story you want. <br /><br />Then, once you’re ready, you can format your book to look and feel the way you want.  Use our previewer to see exactly how your book will look like on all the different readers, and forms out there.  Choose from one of our 17 different professionally designed Chapter themes, or customize and build your own.  Either way, you’re bound to have a professionally formatted and designed book with minimal effort. <br /><br />Combining these two components, I really believe this will be one of the best book writing softwares on the market.  <br /><br /><br />WANT TO SELL YOUR BOOKS LIKE A PRO:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Kindlepreneur.com">http://Kindlepreneur.com</a><br /><br />GET MY FREE BOOK ON INCREASING YOUR EBOOK'S RANKINGS ON AMAZON<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://kindlepreneur.com/amazon-kindle-rankings-2/">http://kindlepreneur.com/amazon-kindle-rankings-2/</a><br /><br />WHAT TOOLS DO SUCCESSFUL SELF PUBLISHERS USE?<br />Check out my Resources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://kindlepreneur.com/resources">http://kindlepreneur.com/resources</a><br /><br />LET'S SOCIALIZE!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Facebook.com/Kindlepreneur">http://Facebook.com/Kindlepreneur</a>{% endraw %}
