With its deep tribal drums, jacked-up beat and Strictly Rhythm vocal sample ‘Rushing’ is a perfect amalgamation of Jamie Jones and Darius Syrossian’s styles, making an impressive inaugural release as a pair. With Jamie heading up Paradise, now on its eighth consecutive year at DC10, and Darius holding down a number of residencies including Do Not Sleep, now at Amnesia for its fifth season, there is no doubt this record will be an Ibiza anthem. ‘Rushing’ is a prime example of how both these artists have reached such caliber, with an irresistible beat and slick groove that makes it an essential tune for this summer and beyond. <br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://defected.lnk.to/Music">https://defected.lnk.to/Music</a><br /><br />Shop: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://defected.com/store">http://defected.com/store</a><br /><br />Defected YouTube is the home of house music with artists including MK, Sam Divine, CamelPhat, Franky Rizardo, Dennis Ferrer, Low Steppa and Amine Edge &amp; Dance<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://defected.com">http://defected.com</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/defectedrecords">http://instagram.com/defectedrecords</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/defectedrecords">http://facebook.com/defectedrecords</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/defectedrecords">http://twitter.com/defectedrecords</a> <br /><br />#HouseMusicAllLifeLong{% endraw %}
