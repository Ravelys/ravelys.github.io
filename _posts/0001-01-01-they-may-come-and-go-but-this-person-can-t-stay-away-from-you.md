Please know that Tarot is not 100% accurate as energy is fluid and constantly changing. Take what resonates and leave what does not. Think prescriptive rather than predictive as a good friend once told me.<br /><br />how does he feel about you, what is he feeling, will we be together, dating, what do they want to say, what will happen next, will they make a move, reach out, what is going on, you and them, you vs them, signs, astrology, you and them, singles, general message, Aries, Sagittarius, Leo, Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn, Aquarius, Gemini, Libra{% endraw %}
