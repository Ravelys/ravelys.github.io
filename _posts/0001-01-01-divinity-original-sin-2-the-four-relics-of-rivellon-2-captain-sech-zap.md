{% raw %}Note: If this video helped you then click on subscribe button. I will keep making helpful videos in future but you can help me too by clicking subscribe button. Thanks.<br /><br />I wanted to do a guide on obtaining Captain set.<br />This video contains locations of quest &amp; combat tactic on honour mode. So you will have no problem with this quest.<br />It took time for me to find all these locations. So I am level 9.<br />*First area, Captain Sech Zapor's soul jar is found in 'Vault of Braccus Rex'.<br />**Second area you must visit is just ahead of entrance of 'Vault of Braccus Rex' cave. You need to cast bless on the stone ring as it is cursed.<br />You can use persuasion to reveal interesting outcomes while chatting with Sech, but I am doing this for more fights &amp; more XP. :D<br />As you can see, Fane has 40 initiative while Sech Zapor has 37, yet he goes first, so be careful. He summons undead.<br />You must read the book from chest, as it requires to explore further &amp; final area of this quest.<br />***Third area is 'close to dragon's beach',north-west of Slane the winter Dragon.<br />{keep in mind you must prepare for difficult fight. Doing this at level 9 won't give you any problem.}<br />Use the phrase to open the door. Again, Sech Zapor will get first turn regardless of your initiative.<br />I am using 'Five star diner' talent &amp; so potion of nimble tumble gives me 100% evasion.<br />You can use 'uncanny evasion' but it grants you 90% dodge,meaning enemies may still have 10% chance to successfully attack. And Sech is one handed so his accuracy will be dramatic.<br />Note: There are often multiple ways to complete a mission in DOS 2. So this quest can also be done with more encounters with Zech Sapor. But it needs persuasion.<br />My gear: How to obtain best gear? <br />Once you reach level 9,legendary belt &amp; rings can be obtained from well. To get epic/legendary crossbow you must unlock the new trader from 'burning pigs' quest. But it is not guaranteed.Helmet is obtained from Gargoyle's maze as quest reward.  Armour is from Fedor, burning pigs quest.<br />Necklace &amp; teleportation gloves can be obtained easily.{% endraw %}
