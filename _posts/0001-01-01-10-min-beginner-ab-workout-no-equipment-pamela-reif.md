{% raw %}Ohhhh yes - a BEGINNER ab workout! ♥︎ / Werbung <br /><br />If you have a hard time keeping up with my super intense &quot;10min Ab Workout&quot; and &quot;10min Sixpack Workout&quot;... THIS ONE IS FOR YOU :) <br /><br />Everybody starts somewhere and my other workouts require suuuper strong core muscles. That's why I really wanted to create an ab workout, that is suitable for beginners - while still being super effective. <br /><br />And listen.. it even includes BREAKS! :D <br />(If you feel like it's too easy with the breaks though: just continue the last exercise during the break &amp; jump into the new movement one once I start with it as well)<br /><br />My mom tried this workout and said, that it's 100% manageable for her .. although she usually isn't so much into working out. That means: no excuses for you. GIVE IT A TRY ♥︎<br /><br />__<br /><br />No Equipment necessary and not much space needed :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. There is a small break included and you can have a look at what exercise is up next. <br /><br />I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles.<br />I have more workouts that are suitable for beginners! Check out my <br />- 20min Full Body Workout,<br />- Good Morning Workout, <br />- 10min Cool Down Routine or my <br />- 10min Sexy Arm Workout<br /> <br />__<br /><br />▸ You can always find ALL SONGS in my workout playlist. I update it weekly &amp; it's available on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. ♥︎<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wmg.click/GetActive">http://wmg.click/GetActive</a><br /><br />1. &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Robin Schulz feat.
