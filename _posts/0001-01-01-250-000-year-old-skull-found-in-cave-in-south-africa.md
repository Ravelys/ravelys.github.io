{% raw %}This child roamed the earth 250,000 years ago. Researchers in South Africa recently found this fossilized skull is from a young Homo naledi. They named her Letimela, which means “the lost one” and they say she was between 4 and 6 years old when she died during the Middle Pleistocene era, which started 335 thousand years ago. The discovery was made in a cave 30 miles away from Johannesburg, where other Homo naledi remains have been found. Inside Edition Digital’s Mara Montalbano has more.{% endraw %}
