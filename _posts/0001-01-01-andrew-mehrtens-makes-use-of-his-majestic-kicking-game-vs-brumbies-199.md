{% raw %}Canterbury Crusaders fly half Andrew Mehrtens makes use of his tremendous kicking game as he clears monstrously from 10 metres from his own line to find space 10 metres from the ACT Brumbies line sending full back Joe Roff going backwards. Roff then plays the ball but gets caught by flanker Scott Robertson and concedes the penalty, which is struck over sweetly by Mehrtens during the Super 12 match in April 1999 at the Canberra Stadium.{% endraw %}
