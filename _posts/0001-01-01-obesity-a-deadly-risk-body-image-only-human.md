{% raw %}Obesity is a global epidemic, and the United States is the fattest nation on earth: 55% of its people are considered heavy enough to seriously endanger their health. This film examines the genetic and environmental factors contributing to the alarming rise in obesity, and follows four patients fighting for their lives and their health.<br />This series explores the science of human appearance as we navigate our modern world of fast food, celebrities, extreme wealth and outrageous ideals to find out the physical effects the 21st century has had on our bodies. We investigate the stories behind obesity, anorexia and body dysmorphia and what happens when plastic surgery goes wrong.<br /><br />Like our content?
