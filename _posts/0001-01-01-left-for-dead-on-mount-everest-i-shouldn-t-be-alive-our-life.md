Now, twenty-two years later, he has a second chance. Despite his age, Lincoln fulfils his lifelong dream, but on the descent is struck by a deadly form of altitude sickness known as a cerebral oedema. Unable to climb and suffering from hypothermia, Lincoln is left for dead at twenty-eight thousand feet. His survival is nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />Watch More Documentaries<br />Our Life - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ">https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ</a> <br />Our History - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL">https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL</a> <br />Our World - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ftuckM">https://bit.ly/3ftuckM</a> <br />Our Stories - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk">https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk</a><br /><br />Our Life brings you fascinating stories of social interest from around the world.
