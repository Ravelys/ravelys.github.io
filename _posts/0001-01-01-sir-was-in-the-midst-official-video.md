A bird’s life is to fly the sky.<br />In rain, sunshine, in warmth in cold. Fly high across the sky.<br />To see you in the eye, to fly across the sky. <br />To play you my new riff, is like jumping from a cliff.<br /> <br />I wanna look past the surface, and see that beauty.<br />Look past the hate. And see that beauty.<br />Lets go through it, we just do it.<br /> <br />If you wanna have it, you gotta start searching.<br />If you wanna keep it, you gotta start live it.<br /> <br />Peel it off, peel it off….<br /> <br /> In the midst of it all<br />It just seems clear<br /> <br />In the midst of it all<br />Everyone is here<br /> <br />In the midst of it all<br />You don't need to dream<br /> <br />In the midst of it all<br />You let yourself feel{% endraw %}
