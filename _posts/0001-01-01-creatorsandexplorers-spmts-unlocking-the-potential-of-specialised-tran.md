{% raw %}How do we move #Bridges, #SuperStructures, and entire buildings? Sarens’ SPMTs are the driving force that enable the most incredible #Transport solutions, and we want to show you how they work.<br /> <br /> Combining power, flexibility, and control the SPMT is the ultimate #SpecializedTransport tool that creates boundless opportunities. They can be linked together in any configuration, rotated in any direction, and hydraulically raised and lowered with incredible accuracy. Each of the axel lines work in unison with the others connected to it, reacting to changing terrain and obstacles through control via the master computer, meaning that millimetric precision can be achieved with even the biggest and heaviest of payloads.<br /> <br /> The immense control and stability of SPMTs allows them to move, uphill, downhill, onto barges, or across uneven terrain without compromising the structure or balance of the payload, meaning that there are no limitations on what can be moved using these incredible tools. No matter the distance, the obstacles, the size, or the weight of the loads, our precision engineering and powerful technology are the solution.<br /> <br /> Using the SPMTs, Sarens have provided transport solutions for the loch doors of the #PanamaCanal, moved a protected 100-year-old building in #China, and escorted #SpaceShuttles in the #USA. The possibilities really are infinite and the solutions need to be seen to be believed!<br /> #NothingTooHeavyNothingTooHigh{% endraw %}
