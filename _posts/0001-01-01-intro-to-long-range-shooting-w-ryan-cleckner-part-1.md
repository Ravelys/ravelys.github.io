He is currently an attorney, competitive shooter, and author of the Long Range Shooting Handbook as well as the cofounder of Veteran's Advocacy Group, a student organization dedicated to educating students about civilian-military relations, military careers and veterans' issues. Ryan also founded New Battlefront Foundation, a non-profit organization that aids veterans in their transition from military to civilian life. Needless to say, John was excited to meet him, especially after seeing him hit a target 1000 yards out, standing up… on his first shot… during an episode of Top Shot on History Channel.<br /><br />In this video, John and Ryan discuss what prevents people from even starting long range sport shooting, plus where to start with equipment and setup. We encourage everyone to check out Ryan’s book to get the pragmatic approach to long range shooting.<br /><br />BERGARA BUILD - Call Interstate Guns and ask for the setup they did for John Lovell. I would recommend upgrading to a better scope, as Ryan made fun of me for the one on the Bergara.<br /><br />TIKKA T3x Tac A1: Call Interstate Guns and ask for the setup they did for John.
