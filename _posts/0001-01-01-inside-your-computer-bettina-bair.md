The critical components of a computer are the peripherals (including the mouse), the input/output subsystem (which controls what and how much information comes in and out), and the central processing unit (the brains), as well as human-written programs and memory. Bettina Bair walks us through the steps your computer takes with every click of the mouse. <br /><br />Lesson by Bettina Bair, animation by Flaming Medusa Studios.{% endraw %}
