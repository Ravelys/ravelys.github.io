{% raw %}Wanted to show people the difference in quality and stabilization between what you see when flying with the DJI Goggles and the final output footage from the DJI FPV Drone with a color grade applied to it.<br /><br />The video was shot in Lugano, Switzerland. <br /><br />These were my settings:<br />- 4K 50p<br />- ISO 100<br />- ShutterSpeed 1/100<br />- ND8 filter by PolarPro<br />- .MOV file format<br /><br />I have a lot of mountain landscape nearby and plan to do a lot of FPV content in the following weeks!{% endraw %}
