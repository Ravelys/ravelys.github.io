{% raw %}I got the first hand look at the newest SM64 TAS for 16 stars. With ten seconds being shaved off, what has been changed since the previous TAS WR?<br /><br />Check out Crackhex! : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_9O61Cu6DpvjDVMLWdUGCQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_9O61Cu6DpvjDVMLWdUGCQ</a><br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM7zphN92zc&amp;t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM7zphN92zc&amp;t=6s</a><br /><br />Simply reacts to the newest Super Mario 64 16 Star TAS. The real question though, is who is going to win the Super Mario 64 Speedrun Race with Mizkif and Emiru. Will Emiru Mario take the throne or will Mizkif &quot;Mario Man&quot; remain victorious? Maybe I'll have to teach Emiru some SM64 strategies in order for her to win. Or maybe Clint Stevens can teach her. Clint if you are reading this please come down to Austin, TX to the Mizkif house. But yeah, SM64 speedruns, like 0 star, 16 star, 70 star, and 120 star are always interesting to watch, especially if they are tool assisted speedruns. Who is this TAS anyway, and how are they good at every single game? Am I taller than TAS?{% endraw %}
