If there is music playing, we will limit each continues recording to under 30 seconds to avoid copyright issues on YouTube -- if there are continued issues with our uploads, we will add 3-second freeze frames. Also, we did not modify the video to account for stability due to timeliness of upload (the sooner the upload for you, the better, is the mantra here).
