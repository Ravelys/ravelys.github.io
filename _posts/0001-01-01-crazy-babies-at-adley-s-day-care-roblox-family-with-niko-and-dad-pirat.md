{% raw %}ðŸŽ¶  Da Da dada Da dada Bringin' This Baby Home! ðŸŽµ<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! Today we are playing my FAVORITE game again... ROBLOX!! Me and Niko turned into babies, and Dad is the Dad. First we had to find a new house that could fit our whole family! We started to drive around to get a new house but dad is a CRAZY driver so it took us a long time. Finally we found a good house by the beach.. and it even had a pirate ship, dad said it looked like Pirate Island! Then we found a treasure map in our pirate ship that took us on a journey up in the mountains like we were camping. While we were on our adventure we ran into a pirate and we had to fight him off with our swords, but then he LAUNCHED me into the ocean so Dad and Niko had to come on a rescue mission for me! When we finally got back on land we went to the airport for a FAMiLY VACATiON!! When our airplane landed we decided to try to fly our own airplane but it didn't work out very well... After that long day we were all tired so we went to sleep! The next day we woke up and decided to adopt another baby that we named Navey! After that we took the babies to Adley's Daycare! I had such a fun time playing family with Dad and Niko!<br /><br />my last video: Barbie DREAMS BiG with Adley &amp; Mom!!
