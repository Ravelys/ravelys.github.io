{% raw %}Paul Andersen explains the importance role of coupled reactions in biology.  He starts by explaining how the power of a river can be harnessed by a water mill to grind grains.  He describes the importance of ATP and how it is used within living organisms.  He highlights many of the coupled reactions between the Sun and your thumb.  He finishes the podcast by talking about REDOX reactions where oxidation is the losing of electrons and reduction is the gaining of these same electrons.<br /><br />Intro Music Atribution<br />Title: I4dsong_loop_main.wav<br />Artist: CosmicD<br />Link to sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.freesound.org/people/CosmicD/sounds/72556/">http://www.freesound.org/people/CosmicD/sounds/72556/</a><br />Creative Commons Atribution License{% endraw %}
