{% raw %}So many new world records happened recently in Super Mario 64 speedrunning. Let's see if I can learn things in order to get the 120 star world record!<br /><br />SM64 16 Star Speedrun in 14:55.123 by GreenSuigi ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElEW9LKGyck">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElEW9LKGyck</a><br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64/invitational">https://soundcloud.com/simply64/invitational</a><br /><br />Simply reacts to the new Super Mario 64 WORLD RECORD speedrun of 16 stars. 16 star mario speedrun world records are always fun to watch, and this isn't an exception! Watching mizkif lose to emiru in a mario 64 speedrun race is also funny as Mizkif threw his controller in the wall! Soy!!! Maybe if Clint Stevens actually comes over to Austin, TX, then Mizkif and Clint Stevens would be calm together. Or I might get replaced by Clint Stevens mario man. But yeah, crazy amounts of SM64 World Records in all the different catagories this week, like 0 star, 16 star, 70 star, and 120 star! 120 star world record might be mine soon. 8 years! 8 years!{% endraw %}
