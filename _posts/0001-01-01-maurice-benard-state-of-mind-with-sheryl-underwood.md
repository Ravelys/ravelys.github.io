{% raw %}Trigger Warning: Talk about suicide, rape and molestation<br /><br />This week I'm joined by Sheryl Underwood. You may know Sheryl best as host of The Talk, CBS’ Daytime Emmy Award-winning talk show. <br /><br />She's also founder and chief executive officer of the Pack Rat Foundation for Education (501c3), an entrepreneur, comedian and actress having guest-starred in the television series The Odd Couple as well as The Young and The Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful. You can also find Sheryl hosting “Sheryl Underwood Radio” which has 511 domestic and international affiliates, and “The World According to Sheryl – The Podcast of Sheryl Underwood Radio.”<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/">https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mauricebenard">https://twitter.com/mauricebenard</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/">https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/">https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind">https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind</a><br />Learn more about State Of Mind at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mbstateofmind.com.">https://www.mbstateofmind.com.</a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about my life, I've recently released &quot;Nothing General About It - How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20</a>{% endraw %}
