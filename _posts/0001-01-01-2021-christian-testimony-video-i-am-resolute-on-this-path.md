After being released, she still could not escape from the CCP's clutches. In order to force her to give up her faith, they threatened her by putting her back into prison, and tried every means possible to get her to sign a paper renouncing her faith in God. Her family members were afraid that she would be arrested and put back in prison, so they monitored and controlled her, trying to prevent her from believing in God and gathering. They also attempted to force her to sign that paper on many occasions. How did she rely on God to stand firm in her testimony? What did she gain?
