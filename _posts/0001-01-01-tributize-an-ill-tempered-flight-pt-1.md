{% raw %}This is one of the first post rock songs I ever wrote. I had initially made a poor rough draft of this song using garage band about 6 years ago. Since then, my brother, Ben Rosenberg, helped me greatly to record/produce a better version of the song.<br /><br />I have many more songs that I am in the process of getting ready to release, but for now this is the only one I feel is ready.<br /><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3djK4p1wSVKdlVkNJJKDsL?si=UVByjG_tSuW9r2CevPK-og">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3djK4p1wSVKdlVkNJJKDsL?si=UVByjG_tSuW9r2CevPK-og</a><br /><br />Ben Rosenberg: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rootsthatruin.bandcamp.com/releases">https://rootsthatruin.bandcamp.com/releases</a>{% endraw %}
