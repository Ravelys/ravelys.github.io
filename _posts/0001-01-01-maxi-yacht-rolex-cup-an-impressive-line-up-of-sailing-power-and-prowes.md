{% raw %}First held in 1980, the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup is one of the most spectacular and exciting regattas on sailing’s international calendar. Staged off Sardinia’s Costa Smeralda – renowned for its breathtaking setting featuring rocky outcrops and turquoise waters – it attracts dedicated owners, highly skilled crews and exceptional yachts. A 44-boat fleet competed in the 2021 edition of the week-long event. Divided into five principal classes based on size and potential, the winners were: Velsheda (Supermaxi); Magic Carpet Cubed (Maxi); Cannonball (Mini Maxi 1); Capricorno (Mini Maxi 2) and Lyra (Mini Maxi 3). Organized by the Yacht Club Costa Smeralda (YCCS), in conjunction with the International Maxi Association (IMA), Rolex has partnered the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup since 1985 as part of its wide-ranging support for yachting dating back more than 60 years.

The Swiss watchmaker naturally gravitated towards the elite world of yachting six decades ago and the brand’s enduring partnership now encompasses the most prestigious clubs, races and regattas, as well as towering figures in the sport, including ground-breaking round-the-world yachtsman Sir Francis Chichester and the most successful Olympic sailor of all time, Sir Ben Ainslie. Today, Rolex is Title Sponsor of 15 major international events – from leading offshore races such as the annual Rolex Sydney Hobart Yacht Race and the biennial Rolex Fastnet Race, to grand prix competition at the Rolex TP52 World Championship and spectacular gatherings at the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup and the Rolex Swan Cup. It also supports the exciting SailGP global championship in which national teams race identical supercharged F50 catamarans on some of the world’s most famous harbours. Rolex’s partnerships with the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, Royal Ocean Racing Club, Yacht Club Costa Smeralda, Yacht Club Italiano, New York Yacht Club and Royal Yacht Squadron, among others, are the foundation of its enduring relationship with this dynamic sport.<br />#MaxiYachtRolexCup #YCCS #Perpetual{% endraw %}
