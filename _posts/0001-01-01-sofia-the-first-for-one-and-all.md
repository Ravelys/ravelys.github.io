{% raw %}Sofia the First - For One and All<br />&quot;S04E26 - Forever Royal&quot;<br /><br />-Lyrics<br /><br />Sofia:<br />They taught us to always be royal<br />But what do those words really mean<br />When you're a prince or a princess<br />When you're a king or a queen<br /><br />We have to look out for our family<br />But our family is bigger than this<br />It includes everyone in the kingdom<br />Every boy, girl, mister, and miss<br /><br />I have to take a stand, a stand for one and all<br />Even if I'm the one who takes the fall<br />Being royal means being loyal to those who count on us<br />For the kingdom I must fight, for in me they placed their trust<br />For one and all, I'm standing tall, for one, and all<br /><br />[Amber: Sofia is right. As the future Queen of Enchancia, I owe it to my future subjects to fight for them.I say we go back.]<br />[Miranda: I know you mean well, but you're still only children.]<br />[Roland: I promise, I will gather my bravest men from all across the land and go back once you are all safe.]<br /><br />Once you spoke of my destiny<br />Of all that I'm truly meant to be<br />Now it's finally clear to see<br />The path that lies ahead of me<br /><br />[Sofia: I'm sorry, but I have to do this. I wish I was a flying horse.]<br />[Miranda: Wait! Sofia?]<br />[Amber:I'm coming with you!]<br />[Roland: Amber! No!]<br /><br />James:<br />As a prince and a future knight<br />I must go back and join the fight<br /><br />Tilly:<br />Sir James is right, we all must go<br />Cedric:<br />To save Enchancia Tally ho!<br /><br />[Roland: Baileywick, turn this boat around!]<br />[Baileywick: Already turned, Your Majesty.]<br /><br />Royal Family:<br />We have to take a stand, a stand for one and all<br />Even if we're the ones who take the fall<br />Being royal means being loyal to those who count on us<br />For the kingdom we must fight, for in us they placed their trust<br />For one and all, We're standing tall<br /><br />Sofia and Amber:<br />For one and all, though we may fall<br />Sofia: For one<br />Amber: For one<br />Sofia: For one and all{% endraw %}
