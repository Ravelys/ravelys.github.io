{% raw %}Having trouble building bigger, rounder and more capped delts? then I've got you covered. <br /><br />I wanted to go over some things that a lot of you might realize you're doing because I catch myself doing it all the time and that is going way too heavy on side laterals. The fact that you're going to heavy isn't that problem, that will absolutely work IF you are getting the lateral head to contract. If you're not here are a few exercises and ways you can get that connection back!<br /><br />If this channel has helped you and you want to support it then check out Ryse and use promo code &quot;RYAN&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rysesupps.com/ryan">https://rysesupps.com/ryan</a><br /><br />#delts #widershoulders{% endraw %}
