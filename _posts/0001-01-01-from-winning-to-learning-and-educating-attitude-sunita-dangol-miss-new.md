{% raw %}Sunita Dangol won Miss Newa 2011 title. Soon, she tried her hand at coaching children preparing for Little Miss Newa beauty pageant. She also ran radio and TV shows. Later she got interested in Nepal Bhasa and hence she started to learn Nepal Bhasa lipi (script) in 2014. She then started to teach the script and even formed Callijatra, an informal group working to promote and preserve the language. Later she even started the one-minute Nepal Bhasa language tutorials online. Today she is known  as ‘Lipi Queen’ and the face of Nepal Bhasa tutorial.<br /><br />As a kid, Sunita Dangol was very studious. She was always a topper. She became more ambitious and now she wanted to top SLC (School Leaving Certificate),one of the biggest exam also known as Iron Gate in Nepal. She was studying very hard and putting her 100% into it. Her exams also went very well. Now she was very excited for her results. But fate had other plans. Sunita secured first division in SLC. She could not top the exam rather she could not even get a distinction. This event became a major turning point in her life. She felt very ashamed and slowly was getting depressed. She felt like a looser and was not interested in anything. As time went by she decided to venture in other fields. What happened next?
