{% raw %}WHO on 14 May 2018 launched the REPLACE initiative to eliminate industrially produced trans fat by 2023 to reduce cardiovascular disease deaths, the world’s leading cause of death.<br /> <br />WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says implementing the six strategic actions in the REPLACE package will help achieve the elimination of trans-fat, and represent a major victory in the global fight against cardiovascular disease. Dr. Tom Frieden, President and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, says “trans-fat is an unnecessary toxic chemical that kills, and there’s no reason people around the world should continue to be exposed.” <br /> <br />More information www.who.int/replace-transfat.{% endraw %}
