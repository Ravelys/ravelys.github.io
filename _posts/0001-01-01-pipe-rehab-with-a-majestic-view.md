{% raw %}With the Majestic Views of Clifton Beaches we experience the contrasting Holiness (not in the biblical sense) of a leaky Sewer Line in the walls of this home. Bring in some fancy machines and these plumbers and we have a fully rehabilitated drain line... with a fresh Rock Hard inner shell üêö of ‚ÄúFamous Blue Epoxy‚Äù (the FBE) thanks Plumvac Projects and Services PTY Ltd Coetzee Plumbing &amp; Maintenance Pty Ltd and Picote Solutions . Great @TeamWork<br /><br />#realplumbers #picote #brushcoating and #Minimiller #Flexshaft caught in #action by the #goprohero7black performing #piperelining , #trenchless #drainrepair{% endraw %}
