{% raw %}Many times as yoga teachers we are asked which are the most beneficial yoga postures - which postures will give you the most benefits? While no yoga postures should be treated as prescriptions (they should all be incorporated into a more complete yoga practice), these 6 postures, plus sun salutations, are considered to give the most benefits. Please remember that you benefit from all yoga postures, at the level at which you are. Enjoy! Demonstrated by Ruth and Mahashakti. Camera: Eduard. Speaker: Sita.<br />For more information on all things related to yoga, videos, blog posts, music please see here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://my.yoga-vidya.org/">http://my.yoga-vidya.org/</a> .<br />For more information on english courses at Yoga Vidya please see here at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yoga-vidya.org/english/seminars/">https://www.yoga-vidya.org/english/seminars/</a><br />You can also support us by making a donation at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yoga-vidya.org/english/donation/">https://www.yoga-vidya.org/english/donation/</a>{% endraw %}
