{% raw %}Learn more about Steam Deck and reserve yours at at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://steamdeck.com">http://steamdeck.com</a><br /><br />One of the most frequently asked questions we've received about Steam Deck is about the components inside it, and whether they're replaceable or upgradable. The answer is a bit more complicated than just a yes or no, so we've made a video to explain all the details. Spoiler alert: we DON'T recommend replacing parts yourself, but we still want you to have all of the relevant information about Steam Deck's components. <br /><br />Anyway, this is the first public look at what's inside the device, so we hope you enjoy it. <br /><br />See this update on Steam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3011210954776539264">https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3011210954776539264</a><br /><br />--<br />Li-ion battery video seen at 0:45 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24fYrV2vCPk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24fYrV2vCPk</a>{% endraw %}
