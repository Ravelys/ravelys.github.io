Ironic now isn’t it?!<br />Cynicism all around make better friends <br />Take your mind on a trip like a Molly binge <br />Don’t comply with the script it is evident <br /><br />Chorus:<br /><br />But I’ve been on my way up If I fall <br />It’s a long way down (Ooh Oooh)<br />Maybe It’s unfortunate that I’m lost<br />Where did I go wrong?<br />F**king me up mentally and I can’t find my sanity<br />Balance out the lows I’m getting high another frequency <br />People love to turn you so cold<br />I’m better on my own <br /><br />Verse 2:<br /><br />Getting comfortable where I stand <br />Gotta take a leap of faith God d*mn <br />Literally I’m drifting why am I so distant?<br />Pushing you away wasn’t part of the plan<br />Regrets / Regrets <br />Creepin’ up instantly <br />Intense / what’s next <br />Searching for some inner peace<br />Demons lurking <br />Will not get away from me <br />My fault / My fault <br />Draining all my energy <br />Taking pride in what I do but I’m slacking <br />Think by now that you’d probably learn your lesson Greg?!<br />Don’t ever question my ability or passion <br />These voices I can never really tame <br />Should turn the page but I’m stuck on the same chapter <br />Oh Lord, please wash away my sins <br />So distracted on the wrong path and <br />You don’t really wanna know where I’ve been <br />Ever feel like nobody understands you?<br />Ever feel like you really wanna runaway?<br />Something missing in your life can’t stand who<br />You’ve become.. so you’d rather just hide the pain<br />Self loathing in doubt <br />Grab the blade / contemplate <br />Then I blackout <br />Sitting on the floor still trying to absorb <br />Pleasing everybody else how I lost myself (That’s Real!)<br /><br />(Chorus Repeat x1){% endraw %}
