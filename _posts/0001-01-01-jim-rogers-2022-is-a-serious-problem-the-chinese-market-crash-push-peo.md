{% raw %}Jim Rogers: 2022 is a SERIOUS PROBLEM! - The Chinese Market Crash Push People Into Bankruptcy<br /><br />In this video, Jim Rogers said: ‚ÄúEvery Government, every Central Bank in the world has been printing huge amounts of money and borrowing and spending huge amounts of money. There are gigantic amounts of money floating around. It‚Äôs going into markets and into the real economy as well. Also, bonds are clearly on a bubble, the property is in a bubble, many stocks are in a bubble. The only thing that‚Äôs still cheap is commodities. Silver is down 60%, sugar is down 70% from its all-time high, oil is down 50%. This is going to end very badly. Even China has debt now. The Chinese saved us in 2009. cause they had a lot of money saved for a rainy day but they started spending it. We now have a bad situation, both a currency collapse and an economic collapse.‚Äù<br /><br />üëâCheck out also: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SofuRxxPKRU">https://youtu.be/SofuRxxPKRU</a> - Why 97% will lose Everything When This HAPPENS...
