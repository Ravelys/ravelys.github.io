{% raw %}Some say life is a roller coaster. What if it was more like this? We don't notice the earth spinning now, so what would life be like if it spun a little faster? Would we all just get really, really dizzy?<br /><br />How might we cope with shorter days and less sleep? How would it affect our climate and geography?
