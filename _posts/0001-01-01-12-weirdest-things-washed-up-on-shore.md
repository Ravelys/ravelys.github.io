{% raw %}Did you know that we only have about 80% of our oceans? And NASA has even stopped exploring the sea because of how harsh the conditions can become just 1000 feet below. But it looks like we don’t even need to dive down anymore because things just keep washing ashore! Not all of them are prehistoric creatures, though, sometimes things as simple as gigantic plastic pipes even wash onshore too. But wait till you see number one, that’s where we put all the good stuff! Here are 12 Weirdest Things Washed Up On Shore that you need to look at right now!<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br />Watch our “10 Weirdest Things Found In Hotel Rooms”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EDGkFqxDBqY">https://youtu.be/EDGkFqxDBqY</a><br />Watch our “10 Weirdest Things People Found In Swimming Pools”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fkoXhN9TBMk">https://youtu.be/fkoXhN9TBMk</a><br />Watch our “15 Weirdest Things Ever Found Inside Animals”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SyihoHLz0Cs">https://youtu.be/SyihoHLz0Cs</a><br /><br />Huge Lego man <br /><br />Seeing a dead carcass of a fish on the beach isn't too uncommon. But finding a huge Lego man? Now that is one in a million moments, or eight actually according to the number on its back! This wasn’t the first one to come ashore too. There was an almost identical creation found in 2007 too. The mystery is that this creation doesn’t have an owner. However, there is a website that shows this Lego man’s name is actually Ego Leonard. You can even buy t-shirts from the website. So who knows, maybe you might find a huge Lego man in your own city on your next beach day!<br /><br />Conjoined whales<br /><br />Sometimes scientists don’t need to send robotic cameras thousands of feet below the surface to find weird creatures. In some cases, they just end up ashore, just like these creepy conjoined whales. They’re only 7 to ten feet compared to the regular 12 to 16-foot gray whale calves, yet they’re even scarier than them! Scientists claimed that even though these twins managed to survive their birth, it was very unlikely they would’ve lived a long life. You might be thinking, “that looks like the after-effects of radiation!” Well, sorry to say, but you’re actually wrong there. These cases are rare but not unknown in the marine world.<br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
