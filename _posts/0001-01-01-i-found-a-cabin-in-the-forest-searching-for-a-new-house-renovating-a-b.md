{% raw %}Searching for a New Home in the Countryside - starting a new chapter<br /><br />🦊🍄My Etsy Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart">https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart</a> (I am closing TOMORROW for 2021)<br /><br />It has been a crazy week, this old barn/cabin (I guess you could call it either) on my future in-laws property has been under renovation for a while now, and my fiancé recently surprised me with the possibility that together we could afford a down payment next year. He has always known I’d love to have my own home. It is such an exciting prospect, though nothing is set in stone. When my mother moved to this area she got a fantastic deal on a little house (which made me quite hopeful), and shortly after the prices went crazy and we started to think that owning a home wouldn’t happen, so we are incredibly grateful for the chance to renovate this barn. Anyway, I wanted to share it with you as it’s super exciting!!! *I got permission from everyone involved to share this information.     <br /><br />❤️No obligation whatsoever, but if you would like to donate to support this channel. $5 will get a thank you postcard (my own art) from me in the mail (you must include address in your note so I can send it!).
