For these I want to make them more interesting and slightly better, but not always necessarily the best perks in the game or anything. So, keep that in mind with these ideas.

The DLC is currently out and features the new killer, The Cenobite, or Pinhead. This is, however, the only content that seems to be releasing with the chapter.
