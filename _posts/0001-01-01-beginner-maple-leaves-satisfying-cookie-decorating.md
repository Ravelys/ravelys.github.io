{% raw %}I thought this simple beginner set deserved it's own satisfying video :) <br /><br />Full tutorial for this set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Rdbi9SqylYI">https://youtu.be/Rdbi9SqylYI</a><br /><br />The Sugar Art Fall Master Elites: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3uR57Xi">https://bit.ly/3uR57Xi</a><br />The Color Ring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ajaIfE">https://bit.ly/3ajaIfE</a><br />*** use code THEGRACEFULBAKER15 for 15% off your order from The Sugar Art!<br /><br />Some other tips: <br />- Use a vanilla royal icing for the best results  <br />- Activate with water (use back of spoon/spatula to mix/activate before mixing into the icing) <br />- Use a dropper to add water (not a spray bottle! The color will go everywhere!)<br />- Start with a thicker consistency than you ultimately need (since you’ll be adding water to activate); I started with a stiff peak piping consistency <br />- Color to a couple shades lighter than you ultimately need <br />- Allow the colors to DEVELOP for an least 1 hour (overnight is even better) <br />- Once colored to desired shade, allow to sit for a least 15-30 minutes - sometimes “streaks” will appear in this time if you haven’t incorporated the color well enough at the beginning and then you can give the icing another good mix before using <br />- For the purposes of this demo I used 8 ounces (or 1 cup) of icing for each color. For the most part I used a total of 1/4 tsp for each color except the Burgundy which needed an additional 1/16 tsp and this Autumn Gold that needed just 1/8 tsp.<br /><br />Cutter: 3.5&quot;' Geometric maple leaf - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brightoncutters.com/products/geometric-maple-leaf?_pos=1&amp;_sid=493788593&amp;_ss=r">https://brightoncutters.com/products/geometric-maple-leaf?_pos=1&amp;_sid=493788593&amp;_ss=r</a><br />*** Use this link to get 10% of your first order: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://i.refs.cc/ajEHZ6xe">http://i.refs.cc/ajEHZ6xe</a> ***<br /><br />RECIPES &amp; CONSISTENCIES: <br />How to make royal icing (step by step): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uE5gYfihKpg">https://youtu.be/uE5gYfihKpg</a><br />ROYAL ICING CONSISTENCIES (step by step): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AObfqJGyXsY">https://youtu.be/AObfqJGyXsY</a><br /><br />Cookie swivel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shop.lcsweets.com/products/the-cookie-swivel">https://www.shop.lcsweets.com/products/the-cookie-swivel</a><br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com">https://www.purple-planet.com</a> &quot;Leave Without Me&quot;<br /><br />-----<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the.graceful.baker">https://www.instagram.com/the.graceful.baker</a><br /><br />Amazon shop of my favorite things: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/the.graceful.baker">https://www.amazon.com/shop/the.graceful.baker</a><br />*I do receive a small commission from items purchased from my shop.
