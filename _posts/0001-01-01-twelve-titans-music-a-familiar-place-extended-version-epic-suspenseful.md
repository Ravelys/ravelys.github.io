Before I end up with a simple extension I tried to make some editing that didn't work very well, but, like other works with 12T's songs, the result was very satisfying.<br /><br />Have an Inspired week, everyone!<br />ðŸŒŸ Thank You for listening to Epic Mondays, the Soundtrack of Your Life is here!<br />DanJ <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram for &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and Spoilers of future uploads <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/epic_mondays/">https://www.instagram.com/epic_mondays/</a><br /><br />ðŸ–Š Please know that I do not place any of the ads on this video.
