{% raw %}grab your bottle of water, a pack of oat milk or 1kg of rice - I'm sure you can find something in your kitchen!  ♥︎ / Werbung <br /><br />PS: if you don't want to use any weights, that's totally fine! You can also perform all exercises without a piece of equipment :) <br /><br />EXERCISES: <br />▸ the CRAWL is hard with coordination, I know hahaha. Start slow &amp; then you quickly get the hang out of it.<br />▸ We switch it up between weighted movements &amp; bodyweight burners, to really challenge our inner sixpack<br />▸ we have a couple of new exercises in there! Hope you like them!!  ♥︎<br /><br />TECHNIQUE:<br />▸ If we lay down on our back, make sure to keep your LOWER BACK flat on the mat. Only lower your legs as far as possible, so your lower back is not lifting off the mat! <br />▸ THINK about your tummy muscles working the entire time. It's about the mind muscle connection! Lift and lower your legs with the strength of your abs, not your thighs. <br />▸ try to hold the tension in your abs as long as possible. Squeeze in your belly button &quot;towards your spine&quot; (inwards) and enjoy the burn :) <br /><br />__<br /><br />Equipment: 4kg dumbbell <br />Alternatives: big water bottle, pack of rice / oats / other grains, pack of milk, no equipment <br /><br />Otherwise we have no breaks (you're used to it by now I guess) and not much space is needed :) If you need a break tho - take it! Just don't quit! <br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
