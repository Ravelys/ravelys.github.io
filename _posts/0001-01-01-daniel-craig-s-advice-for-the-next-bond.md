{% raw %}James chats with &quot;No Time To Die&quot; stars Daniel Craig and Rami Malek, and Rami shares he didn't have to consider accepting a role as the film's villain - it was an instant yes. And Daniel talks about his approach at trying to evolve his portrayal of James Bond over five films before James asks him about what advice he has for the next person to be cast as 007. After, Daniel remembers his early days on the stage when students would throw candy at him (that he ate).<br /><br />More Late Late Show:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube">http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube</a><br />Watch Full Episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4">http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC">http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k">http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/latelategram">http://bit.ly/latelategram</a><br /><br />Watch The Late Late Show with James Corden weeknights at 12:35 AM ET/11:35 PM CT.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.&quot;{% endraw %}
