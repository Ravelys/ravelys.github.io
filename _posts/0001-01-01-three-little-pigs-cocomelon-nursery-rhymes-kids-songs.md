OW! OW!<br />And the wolf ran out of town!<br /> <br />The two little piggies of hay and sticks<br />Learned a lesson all about work and bricks<br />A hard-worked job won’t fall fall fall<br />To a huff, or a puff, at all!<br /> <br />The three little pigs went out that day<br />Now they were free to laugh and play<br />The Big Bad Wolf was gone gone gone<br />And the little pigs danced ‘til dawn!<br /><br />About Cocomelon:<br /><br />Where kids can be happy and smart!<br /><br />At Cocomelon, our goal is to help make learning a fun and enjoyable experience for kids by creating beautiful 3D animation, educational lyrics, and toe-tapping music. <br /><br />Kids will laugh, dance, sing, and play along with our videos, learning letters, numbers, animal sounds, colors, and much, much more while simply enjoying our friendly characters and fun stories.<br /><br />We also make life easier for parents who want to keep their kids happily entertained, giving you the peace of mind that your children are receiving quality educational content.
