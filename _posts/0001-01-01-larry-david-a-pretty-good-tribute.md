{% raw %}a collection of clips from Curb Your Enthusiasm featuring my favorite catchphrase in the history of sitcom television.  Enjoy.<br /><br /><br /><br />And please do yourself a favor, and go buy Seasons 1 through 6 on DVD.  They're pretty good.<br /><br /><br /><br />Prettyyy prettyyyy prettyyyy pretty good...{% endraw %}
