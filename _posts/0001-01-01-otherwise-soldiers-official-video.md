{% raw %}OTHERWISE - Soldiers (OFFICIAL VIDEO). Taken from the album &quot;True Love Never Dies&quot;, Century Media Records 2012. <br />Get this song now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Soldiers_iTunes">http://bit.ly/Soldiers_iTunes</a><br /><br />The song began as a metaphor for the battle that unsigned bands go through to get their message heard as artists, then quickly transformed into an anthem for everyone living on the front-lines of life. &quot;When I started writing the lyrics, I was staring at my bandmates and thinking that they are my brothers in arms,&quot; says the singer. &quot;It was going to be our anthem, but by the time I finished I realized it was an anthem for our whole nation. We are all soldiers fighting for something, whether it's to put food on the table, to be heard, or just to be happy. Every soldier is human, and we're all human.&quot;{% endraw %}
