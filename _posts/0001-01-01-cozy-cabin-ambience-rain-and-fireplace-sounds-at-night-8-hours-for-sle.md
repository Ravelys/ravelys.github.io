{% raw %}Relax in this cozy cabin ambience while listening to the soothing rain and fireplace sounds at night. Grab your book and enjoy this cozy reading nook (and cuddly friend) next to the rain on the window and the crackling fire. This 8 hour sleep ambience video was created by carefully manipulating layers of ASMR ambience sounds like rain and fire to help reduce stress and anxiety. You may find that playing this video in the background will help with deep sleep, focus, and general relaxation. Listen carefully and you may hear distant thunder. #CalmedByNature #CozyCabin #ASMRAmbience<br /><br />This is an 8 hour ASMR ambience video designed for relaxation, sleep, focus, or reading. Relaxing white noise videos like this are created by editing many layers of ambient audio tracks together to create an original background soundscape to help reduce stress and anxiety.
