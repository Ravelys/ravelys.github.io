{% raw %}New album THE FUTURE BITES out now <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/TheFutureBites">https://stevenwilson.lnk.to/TheFutureBites</a><br /><br />&quot;Amongst the hundreds of songs I have written over the years, 'Routine' has a very special place. It's a deeply sad story of loss and denial, but at its conclusion the clouds lift and there is acceptance at least. Having worked with her on 3 previous videos, I knew as soon as I wrote it that it was perfect for Jess to do something amazing with. Even then nothing prepared me for the organic beauty and power of the film she made, a painstaking labour of love that took her months to produce. When we play the song live I look out into the audience and see people swept away with emotion at the combination of music and animation. To find poetry and beauty in sadness is a wonderful thing I think&quot; - Steven Wilson<br /><br />Directed by Jess Cope<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.owlhousestudios.com">http://www.owlhousestudios.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stevenwilsonhq.com">http://stevenwilsonhq.com</a>{% endraw %}
