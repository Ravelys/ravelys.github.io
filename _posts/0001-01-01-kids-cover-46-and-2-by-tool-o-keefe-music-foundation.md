Why? Because art gives voice to our dreams and live music performance is becoming a dying art. Since 2006, OMF has helped over 1000 students make countless music videos… with over 80 million combined YouTube views!  <br /><br />You can read more about us on our website, view other great music vids, and even apply to be an OMF rockstar (as long as you are 18 or under)! You can also buy some cool merch, or support us in recording more great songs and videos in the future.<br /><br />Special Thanks Goes Out To:<br />To all our donors for their continued support!<br />And to the OMF parents, students and crew!<br /><br />Note: OMF purchased a license from Limelight to sell 250 digital copies of the &quot;46 and 2&quot; cover.  Our license number is 35798202.  If we exceed 250 sales, we will purchase another license for additional digital sales.{% endraw %}
