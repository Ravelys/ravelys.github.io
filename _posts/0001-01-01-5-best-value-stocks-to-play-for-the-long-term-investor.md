{% raw %}Value stocks will once again beat growth and Iâ€™ve found five to buy right now.

Over the last five years, stimulus and economic growth have helped growth and tech stocks to outperform and have left value investors with a major case of FOMO. That could be about to change and you need to be creating your list of value stocks to buy. <br /><br />Iâ€™ll start by showing you a simple stock screener for value investing, filtering stocks by market cap and valuation. Weâ€™ll narrow the list down to just five stocks with low PE ratios and other value metrics that leave lots of room for returns. <br /><br />Whether value stocks come back in favor next year or not, these stocks should do well for long-term returns. Even better, if the stock market tumbles, value investing is your best bet for protecting your money. These stocks have already come down from recent highs and are already in value territory, they just donâ€™t have that much further to fall!<br /><br />0:00 Best Value Stocks to Buy Now<br />1:00 Value Investing vs Growth Stocks<br />1:53 Value Stocks Screener<br />4:00 5 Value Stocks to Buy<br /><br />Must Watch Videos! ðŸ˜² Don't miss the most popular videos on the channel!<br />ðŸ¤‘ 7 Monthly Dividend Stocks that Pay My Rent! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Rr4A51xoOZ0">https://youtu.be/Rr4A51xoOZ0</a><br />8 Simple Steps to Start Investing RIGHT NOW! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oRxz_0s875I">https://youtu.be/oRxz_0s875I</a><br />ðŸ’° 10 Penny Stocks Under $5 that WILL Make You Rich! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7B0Rr4n6e_4">https://youtu.be/7B0Rr4n6e_4</a><br />How Many Shares to Buy to Make $1000 a Month? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GnAuLqO6bfs">https://youtu.be/GnAuLqO6bfs</a><br /><br />ðŸ¤‘  Get The Weekly Bow-Tie - my FREE weekly email newsletter sharing market updates, trends and the most important news!
