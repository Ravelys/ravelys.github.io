{% raw %}Connor and Greg inspecting fall grazing paddock to make sure they leave good leaf area intact!

For more grazing info check out my new book &quot; How To Think Like A Grazier&quot; on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://greenpasturesfarm.net/books/">http://greenpasturesfarm.net/books/</a>{% endraw %}
