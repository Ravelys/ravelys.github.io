We’re pretty much at the end of the week. You all know that I always like to end the week off right. What better way to close it out than to share my secret strategy on how to master the crypto gaming industry? I’ve been consistently bringing you all the best alpha when it comes to the NFT gaming sector. I figured that today, I’d stop leaving you all the breadcrumbs and deliver the whole loaf instead. <br /><br />After today, you should have no questions of where or how to find the best projects. These are all of the answers to any questions you might have moving forward. However, there is no need to worry. I will continue to drop knowledge just as I always have been, but it has always been my main goal to transform the E.T Fam into a community full of the smartest and most profitable investors in the entire industry. I won’t quit until that dream is a reality. Much love E.T Fam!<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />01:42 - Crypto gaming market roundup<br />03:59 - Unreal Engine Marketplace<br />08:29 - Creating a good videogame is not an easy task<br />09:03 - What should you ask yourself before investing<br />11:03 = Outro<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice!
