{% raw %}Check out the &quot;exact instructions challenge&quot; that will definitely make you laugh!<br /><br />This hilarious video has emerged of two kids trying to write exact instructions for their dad to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, with little success. <br /><br />This challenge was shot by Josh Darnit, who got the idea from a friend whose science teacher had done a similar experiment back in high school. It shows Johnna and Evan, his kids, taking turns trying to help their father create a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. <br /><br />However, Josh follows the instructions to the letter, leading to funny fails. <br /><br /><br />Via:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.newsflare.com">https://www.newsflare.com</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to Now I've Seen Everything : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xiBW7v">https://goo.gl/xiBW7v</a><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/seen.everything">https://www.facebook.com/seen.everything</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/now.ive.seen.everything">https://www.instagram.com/now.ive.seen.everything</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />More articles: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://brightside.me">http://brightside.me</a>{% endraw %}
