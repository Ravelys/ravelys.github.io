Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)<br />Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest<br />Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed<br />Other times I want more, you put me in debt<br />I want you like Zoloft<br />Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like<br /><br />For me want you to be more into it than this<br />For me I want more than you seem to wanna give<br />I see passion in the way you turn your back<br />Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist<br />There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream<br />I project myself on you, then back to me<br />There's a reason that she doesn't call me back<br />It is the way, it is the way it really seems<br /><br />There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one<br />Some passin' on and out<br />(And out, and out)<br /><br />[WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL &amp; Lil Peep]<br />It wasn't somethin' that I thought about<br />But, knew that you were absolute in doubt<br /><br />[Lil Peep]<br />It wasn’t somethin' that I thought about<br />But knew that you were absolute in doubt<br />I just really wanna talk to you again<br />That’s how I know that I'ma haunt you in the end<br />It wasn’t somethin' ‘til you brought it up<br />I knew that you were tryna make it out<br />Without a single scar, clawin' at my heart<br />I saw you in his car, swear I knew it from the start<br />Bring me down, it’s not that easy<br />Lay me down, just please don’t leave me<br />I remember you were climbin' on top of me<br />Why you actin' like you fuckin' forgot me?<br />I’ve been dreamin' about a place out in Hollywood<br />Tell my mama that I’m movin' to Hollywood<br /> <br />#AbsoluteInDoubt #LilPeep #crybaby{% endraw %}
