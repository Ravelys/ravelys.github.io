{% raw %}Full title reads: &quot;THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Washington D.C., United States of America (USA).<br /><br /><br /><br />Various shots of American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressing Congress. He says: 'We pay tribute to the fighting leaders of our allies, to Winston Churchill, to Joseph Stalin and to Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek. There is very real unanimity between the leaders of the United Nations. I cannot prophesy, I cannot tell you when, or where the United Nations are going to strike next in Europe, but we are going to strike - and strike hard. I cannot tell you whether we are going to hit them in Norway, or through the Low Countries, or in France, or through Sardinia or Sicily, or through the Balkans or through Poland - or at several points simultaneously. Hitler and Mussolini will understand the enormity of their miscalculation that the Nazis would always have the advantage of superior air power, as they did when they bombed Warsaw, Rotterdam, London and Coventry. That superiority has gone... forever. Yes, the Nazis and the Fascists have asked for it - and they are going to get it.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br />(Mute &amp; Track Negs.)<br /> FILM ID:1071.01<br /><br />A VIDEO FROM BRITISH PATHÉ.
