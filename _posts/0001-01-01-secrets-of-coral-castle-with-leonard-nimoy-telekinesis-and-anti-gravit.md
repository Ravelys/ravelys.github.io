{% raw %}Secrets of Coral Castle: Telekinesis and Anti-gravity Documentary<br /><br />Hosted by Leonard Nimoy, this film highlights the amazing stone work at Coral Castle.  If you had visited Coral Castle in the 1940s, you would have been greeted enthusiastically by a man weighing a mere 100 pounds and standing just over 5 feet tall. He would have asked you for ten cents admission and introduced you to his fantasy world.<br /><br />As you moved around his sculpture garden in stone, and the significance of each piece was explained, you would have been witness to the great pride Edward Leedskalnin took in his work. <br /><br />Since it is documented that no one ever witnessed Ed’s labor in building his beloved Coral Castle, some have said he had supernatural powers. Ed would only say that he knew the secrets used to build the ancient pyramids and if he could learn them, you could too.<br /><br />Features of the Coral Castle Museum include a 9-ton gateor door that moves with just a touch of the finger, a Polaris telescope and functioning rocking chairs – all made entirely of stone.<br /><br />We wonder what was the inspiration that could cause a man to spend 28 years to carve a Coral Castle from the ground up using nothing but home made tools. An homage to unrequited love? Perhaps to illustrate ancient sciences that defy gravity? Or maybe just sheer, raw human determination?<br /><br />The Coral Castle is an everlasting mystery to those who explore it.<br /><br />Subscribe to this channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ProperGander">https://www.youtube.com/c/ProperGander</a><br />Coral Castle - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://coralcastle.com/">http://coralcastle.com/</a><br />Coral Castle Wiki - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_C...">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_C...</a><br />The Incredible Mystery of Coral Castle - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rense.com/general39/coral.htm">http://www.rense.com/general39/coral.htm</a><br />Coral Castle Mystery - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.labyrinthina.com/coral-cas...">http://www.labyrinthina.com/coral-cas...</a><br />Coral Castle - Crystalinks - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.crystalinks.com/coralcastl...">http://www.crystalinks.com/coralcastl...</a><br />Today I found out - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.p...">http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.p...</a><br />How One Man Created Coral Castle - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/how-one-man-create...">http://gizmodo.com/how-one-man-create...</a><br />Coral Castle Homestead - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/...">http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/...</a><br />Overcoming Gravity: The Enigma of Coral Castle - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/unexpl...">http://www.ancient-origins.net/unexpl...</a><br />Coral Castle: Masonic Mystery in the Sunshine State - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2014/1...">http://www.thebohemianblog.com/2014/1...</a><br />Coral Castle and Free Energy Technology - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/C...">http://freeenergynews.com/Directory/C...</a><br />Telekinesis - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.crystalinks.com/telekinesi...">http://www.crystalinks.com/telekinesi...</a><br />Real Telekinesis - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thespiritscience.net/2014/10/2...">http://thespiritscience.net/2014/10/2...</a><br />Anti-gravity - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/inno...">http://science.howstuffworks.com/inno...</a><br />Anti-gravity wiki - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gr...">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gr...</a><br /><br />As always, use this info to gather more info.{% endraw %}
