{% raw %}Michael Neill is a coach, adviser, friend, mentor, and creative spark plug to celebrities, CEOs and royalty from the United Nations and five continents around the world. He is a best-selling author whose books have been translated into 14 languages. As founder of Supercoach Academy, an international school that teaches coaching from the inside out, Neill helps transform lives through his writing, teaching and public speaking. He also hosts Supercoach, a weekly radio segment that airs internationally on Hayhouse radio. To Neill, happiness is our natural state and we're always just one thought away from peace.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
