{% raw %}Jesus' Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30). This Kingdom parable of Jesus focuses on three servants who were each entrusted with talents from their master. While two servants invested their talents, the third hid his talent away to the dismay of the master. The point, according to Jesus, is that we are to be faithful stewards of all God's blessings.{% endraw %}
