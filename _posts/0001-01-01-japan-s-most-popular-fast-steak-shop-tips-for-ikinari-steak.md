Ikinari Steak, literally means Sudden Steak, with a simple concept of get your quality Steak Fix on quickly and whenever you want without the hassles and frills of them sit down places.  Definitely my speed, which is why I’m here so often.   Ikinari Steak has been serving up them thick hitters on cast iron plates since 2013, with now over 200 locations all throughout Japan.  After you are seated and let them know your in the market for steak,  you take your table number to the front counter to order your meat just the way you like it, how many grams and how you want it cooked.  And right there on the spot, in front of you, they’ll cut your meat to size.  Quick tip though, the steaks are served on extremely hot cast iron plates so I recommend ordering the meat at least 1 level more rare than prefer so can let the steak cook at the table while the plate cools down. And a little secret between you and me, you can actually order  very rare for the nicer cuts of meat.  Also, for those who like that dark brown brown, they can order it very well done. <br /><br />Price Correction:<br />Dice Cut Steak<br />*300g* ¥2090 / $1842<br /><br />Tenderloin Steak<br />*280g* ¥3058 / $26.96<br /><br />Ikinari Steak<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ikinaristeak.com/for-foreign-visitors/">http://ikinaristeak.com/for-foreign-visitors/</a><br />- Where I Filmed - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/PscrcfwKDRLuA2vk6">https://goo.gl/maps/PscrcfwKDRLuA2vk6</a><br /><br />Get my Tokyo &amp; Japan Merch and show your support! <br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch">https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch</a><br /><br />--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----<br />See My Life in Japan behind the scenes<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra">https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra</a><br /><br />Questions about Japan or Japan Travel?
