{% raw %}Do you know how to administer first aid? Almost all of us remember some basic things about the rules of providing first aid. But is our knowledge correct, or is what we know too fragmented to be useful? Knowing basic first aid methods is very important, but it’s crucial to perform them correctly so as not to compromise the life you’re trying to save.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />Tilting your head back during a nosebleed 0:40<br />Forcing a fainted person to sit up 1:29<br />Putting heat on a sprain or fracture 1:59<br />Trying to remove debri from your body 2:31<br />Treating a burn too quickly 3:05<br />Going straight into the Heimlich maneuver for choking victims 3:37<br />Putting something in a seizing person’s mouth 4:10<br />Prioritizing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for heart attack victims 4:52<br />Not knowing what you’re doing 5:43<br />Using a tourniquet for a bleeding wound 6:17<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a> <br /><br />SUMMARY: <br />- Tilting your head back can make the blood travel from your nose to your throat, which means you could find yourself choking on or swallowing blood.<br />- When someone faints, our immediate course of action is to try to sit them up, especially when shaking them doesn’t seem to be helping. Instead of all that, always start by checking their breathing and pulse.<br />- Ice should be used for acute situations, like suddenly spraining your ankle. Heat is for chronic conditions, like back pain.<br />- If the tool you use isn’t sterile or if you underestimate how deep the wound is, you risk getting an infection and doing further damage.<br />- If the water is to actually help the skin, you need to hold the burn under it for at least 20 minutes.<br />- The Red Cross has updated their guidelines on how to give first aid to choking victims, so instead of going straight for the Heimlich maneuver, here’s what you’re supposed to do instead. Stand behind the victim, lean them forward, and give their back 5 quick blows with the heel of your hand.<br />- In a panic-induced state at seeing someone having a seizure, a lot of people immediately try to block the person’s mouth for fear of the victim biting their own tongue. This is actually dangerous for the victim and for the person trying to help.<br />- A common mistake is to think that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is more important than chest compressions.<br />- The first line of action in all serious first aid situations is to call for help, and let a professional guide you through what you need to do.<br />- If someone has a deep wound in their arm or leg, applying a tourniquet can stop the blood flow to the entire limb, which can actually starve the tissues of oxygen and possibly lead to amputation. Using a tourniquet should never be the first choice.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
