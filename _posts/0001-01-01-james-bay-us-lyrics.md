{% raw %}One of my favorites songs of 2018,  beautiful and meaningful!<br />James Bay  - Us<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />Sometimes I'm beaten<br />Sometimes I'm broken<br />'Cause sometimes this is nothing but smoke<br />Is there a secret?<br />Is there a code?<br />Can we make it better?<br />'Cause I'm losing hope<br />Tell me how to be in this world<br />Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt<br />Tell me how could I believe in something<br />I believe in us<br />After the wreckage<br />After the dust<br />I still hear the howling, I still feel the rush<br />Over the riots, above all the noise<br />Through all the worry, I still hear your voice<br />So, tell me how to be in this world<br />Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt<br />Tell me how 'cause I believe in something<br />I believe in us<br />Tell me when the light goes out<br />That even in the dark we will find a way out<br />Tell me now 'cause I believe in something<br />I believe in us<br />Used to be kids living just for kicks<br />In cinema seats, learning how to kiss<br />Running through streets that were painted gold<br />We never believed we'd grow up like this<br />So tell me how to be in this world<br />Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt<br />Tell me how 'cause I believe in something<br />I believe in us<br />Tell me when the light goes out<br />That even in the dark we can find a way out<br />Tell me now 'cause I believe in something<br />I believe in us<br />I believe in something<br />And I believe in us<br /><br />#jamesbay #us #lyrics #lyricvideo #chill{% endraw %}
