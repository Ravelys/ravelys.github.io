{% raw %}Why doesn't anybody cycle to the hardware store in Canada? In this collab with Shifter, we take the basketball game of &quot;plus 1 minus 2&quot; and bring it to urban cycling, as a way of comparing a similar ride between cities.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, it sucks to cycle to a suburban hardware store in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. But how much does it suck? And how does cycling to the suburbs compare between Calgary and Amsterdam?<br /><br />This video was a collab with  @Shifter . You can watch how he scored these two rides here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iFMhiwtBfAU">https://youtu.be/iFMhiwtBfAU</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/notjustbikes">https://patreon.com/notjustbikes</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/notjustbikes">https://twitter.com/notjustbikes</a><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/notjustbikes">https://reddit.com/r/notjustbikes</a><br />One-time donations: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bunq.me/notjustbikes">https://bunq.me/notjustbikes</a><br /><br />NJB Live (my bicycle livestream channel):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9v57F4xz46KaDsvWfCv8yw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9v57F4xz46KaDsvWfCv8yw</a><br /><br />---<br />Chapters: <br />0:00 Intro<br />0:05 Plus 1 Minus 2 Explained<br />0:42 Loading the game<br />1:01 Amsterdam ride<br />12:18 Why you should want this<br />13:00 Calgary ride<br />21:40 Final results<br />22:29 Patreon shout-out<br />22:39 Outro{% endraw %}
