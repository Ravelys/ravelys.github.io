{% raw %}Is the 150 really worth double the money as the 120? I'm gonna say YES, and not because I sell them but because you'll get more than double the production out of the 150. Plus the extra bells and whistles are worth it as well. <br /><br />As always, thanks for watching and PLEASE ask us for a quote. We don't get paid to do our videos.
