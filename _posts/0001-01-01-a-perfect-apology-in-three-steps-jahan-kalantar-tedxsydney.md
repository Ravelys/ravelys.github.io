{% raw %}Saying sorry is something most of us are terrible at â€“ we favour emojis over emotions. In this touching short talk, criminal defence lawyer Jahan Kalantar offers advice on how to apologise effectively.  Jahan Kalantar describes himself as a &quot;little guy lawyer&quot; who attributes his human rights leanings to his proud Persian heritage, a dislike of bullies and the belief that one person can make a difference. A Sydney-based solicitor, university lecturer and entrepreneur, Jahan left his successful career in finance to pursue law. He is a partner at Executive Legal, where he heads up the serious crime and mental health practice. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
