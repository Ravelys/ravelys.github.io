{% raw %}Set in 1940 this is a uniquely Canadian war story. It follows crew members from a U-boat sunk in Hudson's Bay as they try make their way through an unfamiliar country and people to the, then, still neutral USA. Encounters include Hudson's post staff, trappers, natives, German Hutterite colonists, RCMP and more.  <br /><br />Copyright is held by Janus Films and I will remove it at their request.{% endraw %}
