{% raw %}Very large Dilated pore of winer, filled with old dead skin cells that have oxidized on the surface. This one was actually a shallow cyst with a cyst wall extending down into the adipose tissue. I was initially going to just cauterize the base, however once I removed the thick plug I could visualize the deeper pocket with cyst contents. I decided to punch the small sac out and close the hole left behind with sutures. Thanks to my patient for sharing her procedure. Large DPOW. Large blackhead. Follicular cyst.
