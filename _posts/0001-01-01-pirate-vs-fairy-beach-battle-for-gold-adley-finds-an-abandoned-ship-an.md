One day while doing my duties I heard a loud crashing sound come from the beach! I ran to check it out and I found a giant Pirate Ship! Where there is Pirates there is gold, and I can use that gold to help my friends! I started to search for the gold but the pirate was chasing after me! I had to be really sneaky to try make sure he didn't see me! He caught me for a little bit and threw me in his pirate jail but I broke out and took a lot of the gold! I just wanted to be friends with the pirate and help my friends! While he wasn't looking I turned the ship into a new home for my fairy friends and then I invited the pirate to a party!! The gold wasn't actually gold it was 5 surprise mini balls!! And they were filled with food for my fairy friends! <br />#ad<br /><br />Bye vlog *pshhhhh*{% endraw %}
