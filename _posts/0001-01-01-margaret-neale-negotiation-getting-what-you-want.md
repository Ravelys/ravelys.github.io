{% raw %}Negotiation is problem solving. The goal is not to get a deal; the goal is to get a good deal. Four steps to achieving a successful negotiation: assess, prepare, ask, package. Women increase the chance of a success when a proposal is framed in terms of benefits to your counterparts, team, or organization.
