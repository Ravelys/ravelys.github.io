{% raw %}Okay, there has been a marked increase in the number of requests—nay demands—for the sound of rummaging through a purse since I created the sounds of rummaging through a makeup drawer.  The main theme in these requests is that I had better come up with something...&quot;pronto&quot;. I have enlisted some help (and now owe a massive debt in favors larger than the US debt) and have recorded the sound of rummaging through a purse.  Here it is for those of you who requested it -- even more sounds of feminine rummaging.  I hope that someone finds this relaxing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hoag's Object—a Ring Galaxy<br /><br />Photo—Image taken by the Hubble Telescope July 2001.
