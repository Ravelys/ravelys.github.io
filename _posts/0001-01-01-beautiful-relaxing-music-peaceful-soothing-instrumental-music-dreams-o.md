{% raw %}Beautiful Relaxing Music, Peaceful Soothing Instrumental Music, &quot;Dreams of New Zealand&quot; by Tim Janis.  My instrumental music can help you find deep relaxation, relieve anxiety, and find peace. My music incorporates relaxing sounds of nature and features flute music, piano music, harp music, &amp; violin music. I am a composer from Maine and created my channel as a place to visit, relax and find peace.<br /><br />Join us as we journey through rolling green hills, majestic mountains, breathtaking fjords and the amazing diversity of New Zealand.  <br /><br />In this video we visit stunning locations like, Milford Sound in Fiordland National Park, the purple lupins at Lake Tekapo, the lone tree of Lake WƒÅnaka, the Bay of Islands including Urupukapuka Island the largest island in the Bay of Islands, and we even Hobbiton home to the lush pastures of the Shire.<br /><br />In this video we soar above mountains while viewing wild horses and beautiful nature landscapes. <br /><br />My new CD &quot;Relaxation Volume One&quot; is now available on Amazon - this Cd has some of my most popular songs <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3n47TDn">https://amzn.to/3n47TDn</a><br /><br /><br />Peace join me on my &quot;Open Road Folk Music&quot; I sing and perform my own songs :) Hope to see you there. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTVTf2Q1F11Q8m_YLTVMrvA/">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTVTf2Q1F11Q8m_YLTVMrvA/</a><br /><br />Music information:<br />Composer: Tim Janis <br />Copyright:  Tim Janis Ensemble Inc.<br /><br /><br />#New Zealand<br /><br />#Nature Relaxation <br />#Soothing Music<br />#Relax{% endraw %}
