Come with me as I show you how they make traditional Georgian food and wine in Obcha, Georgia!<br /><br />My friend and guide Tim from Friendly GE began our afternoon at Baiaâ€™s Winery in Obcha. Obcha is located in the Imereti Wine Region, about 30 minutes south of Kutaisi in western Georgia.<br /><br />ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª LEARN MORE ABOUT GEORGIA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://davidsbeenhere.com/asia/georgia/">https://davidsbeenhere.com/asia/georgia/</a><br />ðŸ‘• DAVIDâ€™S BEEN HERE MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/davids-been-here">https://teespring.com/stores/davids-been-here</a> <br /><br />Itâ€™s run by Baia, a young woman who makes incredible wines from indigenous grapes as well as Imereti cuisine! Some of the best Imereti wines are produced right here! I started off in their vineyard and played with their dog before meeting Gvantsa, Baiaâ€™s sister!<br /><br />They grow three white Imeretian grapes in their vineyard, as well as two rare red grapes. We headed up to the property, where they have an outdoor tasting on a terrace right next to the vineyard. <br /><br />We headed into their qvevri space, where the giant clay pots are put underground. It was a little different than others Iâ€™d seen, as they had put gravel down!<br /><br />Then, we visited their aging space, where they have lots of steel tanks. They pump the wines into them after theyâ€™ve been in the qvevries for 4-5 months. Then, it was time to head up to try some wine.<br /><br />She brought out four bottles of wine, all of which have QR codes on them. When you scan them, it takes you to their website and you can see all the steps the grapes went through to become that wine!<br /><br />We had Gvantsaâ€™s 2019 Krakhuna Dry White Wine, a 2020 Aladasturi Rose, a 2020 Tsitska Dry White Wine, and a 2020 dry white wine made from a blend of Tsitska, Tsolikouri, and Krakhuna grapes. <br /><br />The 2019 Krakhuna dry white was light and had a bit more of a tropical flair. Next, the 2020 Aladasturi Rose is a fruity, salmon-colored rose. Then, we tried the Ostkhanuri Sapere 2020, a full-bodied red wine that was dry and easy to drink and reminded me of a syrah.<br /><br />Then, Gvantsa showed us how they make some Georgian dishes, including fried stuffed eggplant rolls and stuffed peppers! She added some crushed walnuts, garlic, and red pepper to make the nigvzis sakmazi, or garlicky walnut paste. Then, she stuffs the eggplant and peppers with it.<br /><br />The nigvzis sakmazi is so good, I had to try it by itself, so Gvantsa fed me some! It was so delicious! <br /><br />Then, we ate on the terrace on the side of their house. We had nigvziani badrijani (stuffed eggplant rolls), bulgaruli nigvzit (roasted and stuffed red peppers), lobio satsivi (green beans with walnut paste), ispanakhis pkhali (a spinach-walnut dip), and much more! Everything was farm to table!<br /><br />We toasted with their 2020 3-grape dry white wine and jumped on the food! First jumped on the nigvziani badrijani, or stuffed eggplant rolls. I loved the nuttiness of the walnut and the addition of the vinegar.<br /><br />The wild thorns tkhali were garlicky and excellent, and the bulgaruli nigvzit (stuffed red peppers) didnâ€™t contain coriander but contained more spice and vinegar! I also loved the ispanakhis pkhali and the lobio satsivi. They were all so tasty and unique! <br /><br />The summer salad contained juicy tomatoes from the area. Next was the 2020 Tsitska dry white wine, followed by the chicken tabaka and tkemali, or sweet and sour plum sauce. <br /><br />Finally, I jumped on the khachapuri, which was oozing with melted cheese but was still soft and buttery. It was amazing! Best of all, you can have this entire Baiaâ€™s Winery experience for GEL 50/$16 USD! For GEL 100/$33 USD, you can stay there overnight! Finally, I finished with the lobio, or hearty bean stew!<br /><br />Where have you been?<br /><br />Subscribe Here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereSub">http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereSub</a><br />Top videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereTopVideos">http://bit.ly/DavidsbeenhereTopVideos</a><br /><br />Follow Me:<br />+ INSTAGRAM â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/davidsbeenhere">https://instagram.com/davidsbeenhere</a>  <br />+ FACEBOOK â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/davidsbeenhere">https://www.facebook.com/davidsbeenhere</a>  <br />+ TWITTER â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/davidsbeenhere">https://twitter.com/davidsbeenhere</a> <br />+ MY BLOG! â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://davidsbeenhere.com/">http://davidsbeenhere.com/</a> <br /><br />Contact Me:<br />+BUSINESS EMAIL â–º david@godandbeauty.com<br /><br />#Davidsbeenhere #Obcha #Georgia #DavidInGeorgia<br /><br />About Me:<br /><br />My name is David Hoffmann.
