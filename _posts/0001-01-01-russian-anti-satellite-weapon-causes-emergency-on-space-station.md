{% raw %}Yesterday the Russian military tested a new Anti-Satellite missile on an old, dead Soviet satellite. The test was a success and now there are thousands of pieces of debris crossing the orbit of the Space Station. Space is big, and the chances of an impacts are low, but this particular satellite was relatively close to the altitude of the ISS, rather than low down like recent US and Indian tests meaning the debris will remain in orbit longer and have a long term cost for operations in Low Earth Orbit.<br /><br />Follow me on Twitter for more updates:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DJSnM">https://twitter.com/DJSnM</a><br /><br />I have a discord server where I regularly turn up:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/zStmKbM">https://discord.gg/zStmKbM</a><br /><br />If you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley">https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley</a>{% endraw %}
