He was the lead developer of Overtone and Quil – Clojure-based projects for the expression of sound and image. More recently he has created Sonic Pi – a live programming environment for creating music from code with a focus on education.<br /><br />More on Sam Aaron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://codesync.global/speaker/sam-aaron/">https://codesync.global/speaker/sam-aaron/</a><br /><br /><br />THE SPEAKER - JEREMY RUSTON<br />Creator of TiddlyWiki<br /><br />Jeremy Ruston cut his teeth writing books about the home computers of the early 1980's. He has worked at several startups, an investment bank, and enjoyed a stint as Head of Open Source Innovation at BT plc after his previous company was acquired by them. Jeremy is the creator of TiddlyWiki (&quot;&quot;a hypertext card index system from the future&quot;&quot;), and has led the community for nearly 15 years. His passion is building tools that extend the capabilities of individuals and groups.<br /><br />More on Jeremy Ruston: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://codesync.global/speaker/jeremy-ruston/">https://codesync.global/speaker/jeremy-ruston/</a><br /><br /><br />THE SPEAKER - ROBERT VIRDING<br />CO-CREATOR OF ERLANG, TRAINER<br /><br />Robert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.<br /><br />More on Robert Virding: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-virding/">https://codesync.global/speaker/robert-virding/</a><br /><br /><br />---<br /><br />CODE SYNC &amp; CODE MESH LDN 19<br />Code Mesh LDN is powered by Code Sync.
