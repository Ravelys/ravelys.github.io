But today around 9% of humanity is starving and at the Amazon woods are on fire (#1, #2). So, to feed all people, we need more arable land.<br />In the future we also want to avoid fossil resources. We can then use biofuels for aircrafts and ships (#3). Plastics should be bio-plastics (#4). <br />Agriculture shall become more sustainable, but organic farming needs 15% more land area (#5). Also, more space should be given to biodiversity. <br />According to the IPCC, we even have to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to save the climate (#6). Here, afforestation can make a significant contribution (#7).<br />For all this we need more fertile land. But that does not exist. <br />Yet agriculture has actually doubled its productivity in the last 40 years (#2). Unfortunately, the rapid growth of world population has - literally - eaten up much of this agricultural progress (#1).<br />Despite these increasing demands, agriculture can do all this for us. However, one prerequisite is that we stop eating animal-based food (#8, #9). This is because today we produce animals on 80% of our agricultural land, but they provide only 18% of our calories (#2). Animal production is thus extremely inefficient. Only if we avoid this inefficient production, we will have a chance to sustainably produce all we need for a good life for all people on this earth on the available land area (#10).<br /><br />More on this topic:<br />#1  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#1">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#1</a><br />#2  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#2">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#2</a><br />#3  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#3">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#3</a><br />#4  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#4">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#4</a><br />#5  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#5">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#5</a><br />#6  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#6">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#6</a><br />#7  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#7">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#7</a><br />#8  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#8">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#8</a><br />#9  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#9">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#9</a><br />#10 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#10">https://oneminuteanswer.de/pfennig-en#10</a>{% endraw %}
