Sometimes all it takes to break down ones borders is facing your fears, in my case buying a motorcycle and setting off on and eye opening adventure. This song was recorded due to the confidence gained on this journey. I hope you enjoy it -Julia<br /><br />info: Julia rides a motorcycle from Hanoi, Vietnam 4,000 miles through Laos to Cambodia while writing melodies and lyrics on her ukulele. This montage is set to one of those songs, &quot;On My Own&quot; from her debut album - Parsley (Availible now).<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.juliapietrucha.pl/">http://www.juliapietrucha.pl/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/juliapietruchafanpage">https://www.facebook.com/juliapietruchafanpage</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/julia_pietrucha/">https://www.instagram.com/julia_pietrucha/</a><br />Contact: infojuliapietrucha@gmail.com<br /><br />Lyrics and music by Julia Pietrucha<br />Produced and published by Julia Pietrucha and Ian Dow<br />Cover art and design by Ian Dow{% endraw %}
