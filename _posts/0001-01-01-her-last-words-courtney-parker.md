{% raw %}*** I HAVE A NEW CHANNEL! ***<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FinkerMash?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/FinkerMash?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Instagram: courtneymayparker<br />Snapchat: courtneymay96<br /><br />A while ago I wrote my own lyrics to the song &quot;Perfect Couple&quot; by Fozzy and Van C, I spent a really long time on perfecting them and didn't want them to go to waste so I recorded this, I originally spoke it but then realised singing it sounded slightly better. I know I'm not a good singer at all and the point of uploading this was not to show off my voice or anything like that, I might get made fun of for making this, I just didn't want to waste something I spent so long writing. So, I hope at least a few people enjoy this as it's taken me a lot of courage to upload.<br /><br />Music: Atmosphere - The Last To Say (Instrumental)<br /><br /><br />***LYRICS***<br /><br />Just an average girl<br />She always wore a smile<br />She was cheerful and happy for a short while<br />Now she's older, things are getting colder<br />Life's not what she though, she wishes someone had told her<br />She told you she was down, you let it slip by<br />So from then on she kept it on the inside<br />She told herself she was alright<br />But she was telling white lies<br />Can't you tell? Look at her dull eyes<br />Tried to stop herself from crying almost every night<br />But she knew there was no chance of feeling alright<br />Summer came by, all she wore was long sleeves<br />'Cause those cuts on her wrists were bleeding through you see<br />She knew she was depressed, didn't want to admit it<br />Didn't think she fit it, everyone seemed to miss it<br />She carried on like a soldier with a battle wound<br />Bleeding out from every cut her body consumed<br />She had no friends at school, all alone she sat<br />And if someone were to notice she would blame the cat<br />But those cuts on her wrist, they were no mistake<br />But no one cared enough to save her from this self hate<br />Things were going down, never really up<br />And here she is now stuck in this stupid rut<br />She knew exactly what she had to do next <br />Just stand on that chair and tie the rope around her neck<br />She wrote a letter with her hands shaking wild<br />&quot;Look at me now, are you proud of your precious child?&quot;<br />But she knew that her parents weren't the ones to blame<br />It was the world that should bow down it's head in shame<br />She stood up on the chair and looked out at the moon<br />Just don't think, it'll all be over soon<br />The chair fell down as she took her final breath<br />It's all over, all gone, now she's greeting death<br />Her Mum walks in, she falls down to the floor<br />And now nothing can take back what she just saw<br />The little girl that she raised is just hanging there<br />Her body's pale and her face is violently bare<br />She sees the note and unfolds it with care<br />All she does is stare, &quot;How can this be fair?&quot;<br />She starts reading as the tears roll down her face<br />&quot;I'm sorry Mum but this world is just not my place<br />I've tried for so long to fix this and fit in<br />I've come to realise this world's full of sin<br />There's nothing for me here, I'm just a waste of space<br />I've got no reason to stay here with this awful race<br />It's a disgrace, I was misplaced<br />Born in the wrong time, and in the wrong place<br />It's okay though, 'cause you'll see me soon<br />You'll know when your time has come, just look at the moon<br />As it shines bright, throughout the night<br />And remember everyone's facing their own fight<br />But I can't deal with the pain, I'm not a fighter<br />You'll make it through the night, just hug your pillow tighter<br />So let the world know, that I died in vein<br />Because the world around me, is the one to blame<br />And I know in a year, you'll forget I'm gone<br />'Cause I'm not really something to be dwelled on<br />That's what they use to tell me, all those kids at school<br />So I'm going by the law majority rules<br />My presence on this earth is not needed any longer<br />And if anything, I hope this makes you stronger<br />You're the best friend, that I ever had<br />Such a shame I had to make you so very sad<br />But just remember that you meant everything to me<br />And to my heart, you're the only one that held the key<br />Now it's time to go, I'm running out of space to write<br />And yes I lost my fight, but please just hold on tight<br />I'm watching over you, from the clouds above<br />And sending down the purest and whitest dove<br />To watch over you, and be my helpful eye<br />So this is it world, goodbye.&quot;{% endraw %}
