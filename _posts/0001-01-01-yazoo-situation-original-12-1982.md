{% raw %}buy for example here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/album/only-yazoo-the-best-of-yazoo/id668998939">https://itunes.apple.com/de/album/only-yazoo-the-best-of-yazoo/id668998939</a><br /><br />&quot;Yazoo&quot; is singer &quot;Alison Moyet&quot; and &quot;Vince Clarke&quot;, who beforehand was part of &quot;Depeche Mode&quot;. Yahoo released their first single &quot;Only You&quot; in 1982. On the flipped / B-Side they released &quot;Situation&quot;. After also the B-Side got a big feedback they decided to release the track again as an A-Side in the US. It went up to #1 in the Billboard Ho Dance Charts.<br /><br />Of course we do not own any rights but thought it is a good idea to share our musical roots and support their music...{% endraw %}
