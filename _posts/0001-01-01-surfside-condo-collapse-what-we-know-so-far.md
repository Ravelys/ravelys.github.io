{% raw %}On June 24, 2021, a portion of Champlain Towers South, a 12-story condominium in Surfside, Florida, near Miami Beach, collapsed around 1:30 am. It was one of the most deadly structural collapses in U.S. history. This video summarizes the events of this unthinkable tragedy, a few of the structural engineering issues that may have played a part, and finally the process of forensic structural investigations.<br /><br />Links:<br />-My playlist on concrete can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTZM4MrZKfW90PdaBFt70BLTbz1bTF6Mn">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTZM4MrZKfW90PdaBFt70BLTbz1bTF6Mn</a><br />-Thanks to@Mike Bellfor sharing his animation of the collapse.
