Watch this video to learn how to raise soft palate easily. First, I am going to explain what the soft palate is and where to find it (soft palate vs hard palate). I’ll spend a few minutes showing you hard and soft palate anatomy and I’ll show you exactly where soft palate and hard palate are in your mouth (and check out the pictures with soft palate hard palate). <br /><br />Soft palate elevation plays an important role in swallowing (and I will show you an x-ray video) but it can be used for better singing too. The soft palate and uvula are structures that can move up and down when singing, depending on the singing task. <br /><br />I will show you how to lift soft palate with an easy trick to demonstrate the function of the soft palate. Once you understand the role of soft palate singing, it will be easier to raise soft palate on demand. But of course, you need to do the soft palate exercises singing. <br />Katarina H. <br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />SUBSCRIBE for More Videos with Tips for a Healthy and Free Voice: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tips.how2improvesinging.com/subscribe">http://tips.how2improvesinging.com/subscribe</a><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Soft Palate Function: Lift Soft Palate Easily with This Trick at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nTlRU2GXX2o">https://youtu.be/nTlRU2GXX2o</a><br />#KatarinaH #vocalhealth #vocalfreedom{% endraw %}
