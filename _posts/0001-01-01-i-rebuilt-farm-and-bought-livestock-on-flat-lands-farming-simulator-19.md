{% raw %}Starting off with only 20$ on a completely flat map. Starting off we got a big problem as having only a few dollars makes it very hard to make any money to afford machinery or more land... Nevertheless, we find a way to lease a shovel and a small push able lawn mower to get us started. After some time we get 300$ which is the price to lease a tiny little john deere mower that lets us collect grass without a need of a shovel. With this our yourney starts off getting a bit more fast paced until we are able to afford a tractor that puts us on a completely different level from where we started and we go on to even building a house that costs over 25 thousand dollars.<br /><br />This video also includes:<br />Farming Simulator 2019 Timelapse<br />Farming Simulator 2019 Gameplay<br />Farming Simulator 2022 <br />Farming Simulator 2022 Timelapse<br />Farming Simulator 2022 Gameplay{% endraw %}
