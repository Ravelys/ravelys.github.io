{% raw %}Full Show of The Final Word Weekly, Season 11, Ep 3. <br /><br />We have a guest co-host! And it's IPL finals time. In that three of the finals have already happened, and the playoff for the title takes place 24 hours after this show goes live. A great time to talk to CricViz maestro Ben Jones, who examines a ream of analytical data on every ball of the tournament. And with Adam on holiday, Ben sticks around for a spot of Nerd Pledge, a look at Shikha Pandey's wonderball, and some measurement of England's Ashes squad.<br /><br />Your Nerd Pledge number this week:<br />3.12  - Mike Meehall Wood<br /><br />Send us a Nerd Pledge at patreon.com/thefinalword <br /><br />Find previous episodes at finalwordcricket.com <br />44% off Wisden Cricket Monthly at bit.ly/wcmtfw <br />20% off primo WoodstockCricket.co.uk kit with the code TFW20 <br />The Final Word is part of the Bad Producer Podcast Network{% endraw %}
