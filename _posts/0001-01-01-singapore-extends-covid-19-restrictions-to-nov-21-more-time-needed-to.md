{% raw %}Singapore will extend its COVID-19 restrictions to Nov 21 as more time is needed to stabilise the COVID-19 situation, authorities said. The &quot;stabilisation phase&quot; was originally scheduled to last until Oct 24.<br /><br />In comments to journalists, Minister Lawrence Wong added that it is &quot;still too risky&quot; to allow groups of up to five people from the same household to dine together at restaurants &quot;because of the pressure on the healthcare system&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;We know this is a difficult time for everyone in many ways, I would say this is probably the most difficult phase in our journey through COVID so far. But this phase will not last indefinitely,&quot; said Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/3DPblKG">https://cna.asia/3DPblKG</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/youtubesub">https://cna.asia/youtubesub</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to our news service on Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia/telegram">https://cna.asia/telegram</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow us:<br /><br />CNA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cna.asia">https://cna.asia</a><br /><br />CNA Lifestyle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cnalifestyle.com">http://www.cnalifestyle.com</a> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.facebook.com/channelnewsasia</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.instagram.com/channelnewsasia</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia">https://www.twitter.com/channelnewsasia</a>{% endraw %}
