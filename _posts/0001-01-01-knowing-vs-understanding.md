{% raw %}Have you ever thought about the difference between knowing and understanding?<br /> <br />Thinking about your work, do you just know or do you really understand it?<br /> <br />What are the areas of your life you know verses those you really understand?<br /> <br />There is a large difference between knowing and understanding and it can really affect our daily work life. Knowing is an awareness of knowledge whereas an understanding is a deeper conceptual connection with this knowledge and then being able to apply it to your life. Understanding the difference between the two can benefit your productivity and work process and minimize frustrations with those you may work with. In this GET YOUR MIND ON, I differentiate knowing and understanding and how it can best allow you to succeed.{% endraw %}
