My goal is to focus on the real-world aspects of business, giving practical tips and tricks that are not usually covered in school.<br /><br />This channel is a platform to help entrepreneurs and business owners succeed.  It is also to help the world at large to be more effective and successful.  The world can certainly use more inspiring leaders, more successful entrepreneurs, and more capable managers - that is what I would like to help bring about.<br /><br />Who Am I?<br />I am a practicing management consultant, former CEO, and entrepreneur.  I have led many businesses to success, as well as several startups.  Among other things, I have an engineering degree, a master's degree in finance, and a master black belt in lean six sigma.<br /><br />I have worked across five industries, and have worked in both large enterprise and small businesses.  In the last five years, I have also been mentoring startup founders and teaching business at a post-graduate level.<br /><br />Why I Want To Involve My Community:<br />The only way this channel will succeed is with YOUR help.  In order to know how best to proceed, I need constant feedback from YOU.  What topics should I cover?  What challenges are you facing?  What questions do you have?  What changes should I make?<br /><br />Please contact me with questions, and I will try my best to help.  Best of luck!<br /><br />Thank you for being here and reading this, and have yourself an amazing day!<br /><br />-Bill &quot;The Companies Expert&quot;<br /><br /><br />#jobinterview<br />#jobinterviewquestions<br />#interviewquestionsandanswers<br /><br />(Please note:  I own the copyright to all music contained in this video, and can provide verification upon request.){% endraw %}
