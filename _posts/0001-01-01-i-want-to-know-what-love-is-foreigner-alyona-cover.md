I was born in Russia, and I am a singer, a musician, <br />I play the piano and do many arrangements myself, I‚Äôm in love with 80s and 90s rock. In Russia, I played with several bands. One of them is the best Led Zeppelin tribute band in Russia called &quot;Plumbum Dreams&quot;.  The other one is called &quot;Back from the USSR&quot;, where we played Beatles songs in my own arrangements. We played in Liverpool, England almost every year on the Beatles week fest.  My dad, Valeriy Yarushin is my bass player in this band. He's a legend of Russian folk-rock and his band ‚ÄúAriel‚Äù was most popular in the 70s and still is now.  I learned a lot from him.<br />In 2004, I won the ‚ÄúInternational Hopes of Europe‚Äù competition in Sochi, Russia along with the ‚ÄúGrand Prix‚Äù prize for singing I Have Nothing by Whitney Houston.<br /><br />During my career, I had the opportunity to perform with great artists such as Chick Corea, Chris Slade (AC/DC drummer), Ryan Roxie (Alice Cooper guitarist), Innes Sibun (Robert Plant's guitarist), David Campbell (musical producer and arranger of Muse and Adele), Brian Tichy (drummer for Whitesnake, Billy Idol, Foreigner, Ozzy Osborne), Hal Bruce and others. <br />I like a lot of different song styles like rock, pop and jazz. I love classic rock.Bands like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Boston, Oasis, Jeff Buckley, Vixen, Janis Joplin, Aerosmith, Guns'n'Roses, Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Winger, Skid Row, Sandy Saraya and others.<br /><br />For some of my covers I do full MIDI instrumentals by myself using an M-Audio Oxygen MIDI keyboard. I also do all the back vocals &amp; mixing and mastering by myself using Logic Pro. <br /><br />Tags: Alyona Yarushina, Alyona cover, Aly, Foreigner - 'I Want To Know What Love Is', I wanna know what love it, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; is a power ballad by the British-American rock band Foreigner.
