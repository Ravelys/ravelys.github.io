{% raw %}Finally a MEDIUM Level workout, that is not soooo difficult :) we will train the side parts of our tummy: for a trained and toned waist ♥︎  <br /><br />This routine focusses on ab exercises, that target your obliques. All kinds of side crunch variations (I think I got really creative here haha) and a couple of (easy) side planks for the ultimate burn. <br /><br />IF YOU WANT TO: you can also do the hard side plank version (not on your knees, but on your feet). <br /><br />Have fun with this one &amp; tell me how you like it! <br /><br />__<br /><br />No Equipment necessary, no breaks and not much space needed :) If you need a break tho - take it! Just don't quit! <br /><br />The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. <br />__<br /><br />▸ you can find FREE WORKOUT PLANS on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations.
