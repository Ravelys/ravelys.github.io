{% raw %}Thanks for watching. In this video I explain the law of demand, the substitution effect, the income effect, the law of diminishing marginal utility, and the shifters of demand. Make sure that you understand the difference between a change in quantity demanded and a change in demand. This is the first video in the unit Playlist. Make sure that you watch the the next two videos about supply and equilibrium so you can put it all together. I hope that you like this video.
