{% raw %}Available from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thestunning.net/store.">https://thestunning.net/store.</a> The 30th anniversary edition of this classic, multi-platinum,  Irish rock album is reissued on vinyl for the first time since 1990. Also with a beautiful new song book to accompany it. The book is not just for those who want to learn how to play the songs, itâ€™s also a beautiful companion piece to the album. Lovingly written by Steve and Joe, it features the story of the making of the album with never-before-seen photos and the inspiration behind each of the tracks. The guitar and piano arrangements are easy to follow with handwritten notes and playing tips written by the band themselves.{% endraw %}
