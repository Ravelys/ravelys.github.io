{% raw %}His Divine Holiness Paramahamsa Nithyananda on the auspicious day of His happening - Jayanthi 2011 starts the day with a visit to His beloved Arunachaleswarar Temple in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. This is the largest temple in the world dedicated to Shiva, and dates back to thousand years, with mentions in the great Tamil works Thevaram and Thiruvasagam. <br /><br />Tiruvannamalai is known for its unbroken lineage of enlightened masters, the capital of Shaivism, and it Is in this holy land that the Avatar chose to land in human form. Swamiji shares the leelas of His many experiences here - His birth, His schooling, His first enlightenment experience, His experiences with His gurus and more. It was in this temple that He met and spent time with Arunagiri Yogeeshwara, Paramashiva Himself, who manifested to awaken Swamiji to the final realization of His identity as Paramashiva. <br /><br />Watch, share and like the videos and Subscribe to our channel to be notified of the next upload.<br />click <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/20j90wr">http://bit.ly/20j90wr</a> to subscribe.<br /><br />Website and Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nithyananda.org">http://www.nithyananda.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nithyananda.tv">http://www.nithyananda.tv</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.innerawakening.org">http://www.innerawakening.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SriNithyananda">https://twitter.com/SriNithyananda</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda">https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda</a><br /><br />Paramashivoham: 22-day Ultimate Spiritual Journey with the Avatar HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam <br />Learn more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paramashivoham.nithyananda.org">https://paramashivoham.nithyananda.org</a>{% endraw %}
