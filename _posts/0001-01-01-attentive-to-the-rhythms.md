{% raw %}'Attentive to the rhythms' : a song inspired by my friend and colleague, Geoff Colmer. Geoff has had a torrid year battling myeloma, and now incredibly he is beginning a year as President of the Baptist Union - his theme'attentive to the rhythms of grace'.<br /><br />As the Kingfisher streaks out of the sky <br />radiant golden and blue<br />I have waited so long to behold this sight <br />I have watched the horizon for you<br /><br />I’ll be attentive to the rhythm of grace<br />looking for a rumour of angels <br />in the broken places        <br />In stillness and quiet I’ll wait<br />I will search after you<br /><br />As I stand on the edge of an ocean shore<br />braced against wind and the rain<br />In the groan of the sand in the ebb and the flow <br />I encounter a presence I know <br /><br />I’ll be attentive to the rhythm of grace<br />looking for a rumour of angels <br />in the broken places        <br />In stillness and quiet I’ll wait<br />I will search after you<br /><br />I stand in silence, <br />watching the sunrise, <br />waiting for the chorus of the dawn to be sung <br /><br />In the eyes of a child and an old man too<br />there’s a love that is strong, and is true<br />and the joy on their faces <br />as they laugh and they play<br />is a vision that points me to you<br /><br />I’ll be attentive to the rhythm of grace<br />looking for a rumour of angels<br />in the broken places        <br />In stillness and quiet I’ll wait<br />I will search after you{% endraw %}
