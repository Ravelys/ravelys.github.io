{% raw %}MOST EXCITING LIFE HACKS<br /><br /><br />Did you know you can make a flute with a carrot! Wait what? You heard me! All you have to do is cut it in the right places. Then get a party started!<br /><br />You will need:<br />A drill and bits to make a large and small hole. A 1/2&quot; drill bit and a 15/64&quot; bit worked for me.<br />Sharp knife<br />1 or more carrots<br />Cutting board<br />Long, narrow tools to take carrot debris out of the hole. E.g. skewer or chopstick.<br /><br />Using the sharp knife, cut the carrot top off of the carrot. This provides a flat surface that you will drill into.<br />Using the 1/2&quot; drill bit, drill a hole that starts at the flat surface of the carrot that you just made, and goes along the length of the carrot. I went about 1/3 of the way into the carrot.<br />Take out all of the carrot bits, as they will prevent the sound from being clear and sharp. Use a skewer, chopstick, the bit, or anything you can find that will fit down the hole. I used a pen.<br /><br />Hold the carrot in front of you with the carrot top side facing up.  You will need to drill a hole, using the smaller bit, a bit down from the top of the carrot. I chose a spot that ended up being about an inch down the side. I've found that if you go too far down, the sound is not very good.<br /><br />You may want to blow down the various holes and tap the carrot on the cutting board to ensure the debris is all removed.<br />Now you are ready to play!  Have fun, make more, have each person play one and see what sounds you get!<br /><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />02:35 Using a bottle in the kitchen<br />04:43 Cool uses for a Tic-Tac box<br />08:01 Easy polymer clay ideas<br />13:33 Unusual DIY musical instruments<br />17:58 Don't throw away plastic bottles<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/">https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/">https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/5m_crafts">https://twitter.com/5m_crafts</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute MAGIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ldditZ">http://bit.ly/2ldditZ</a><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fWbJqz">https://goo.gl/fWbJqz</a><br />Subscribe 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PEuLVt">https://goo.gl/PEuLVt</a><br /><br />The Bright Side of Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me">http://www.brightside.me</a><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a> This video is made for entertainment purposes.
