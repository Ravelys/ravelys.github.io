{% raw %}PLEASE READ - Comments have been disabled. <br />If you do have any positive comments you would like to share, please do mail me. Iâ€™d be really encouraged to hear from you. <br /><br /><br />John 13 v 34-35 &quot;A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.&quot; <br /><br /><br />I know the reference should be 2 Chronicles 7:14, at the end, not 2 Corinthians 7:14. Sorry for that mistake, but I can't amend it.<br /><br /><br />This is one of my favourite songs ever , the message is fantastic, it speaks of how God is mighty to save us and how is so mighty that he can move mountains.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, there is no copyright infringement intended here, just the spreading of Gods word. <br /><br />Also, I don't own the bible verses, they're from God's word, which He wants the whole world to hear, so no fear of copyright there! Haha. His Word is unique  :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoy,{% endraw %}
