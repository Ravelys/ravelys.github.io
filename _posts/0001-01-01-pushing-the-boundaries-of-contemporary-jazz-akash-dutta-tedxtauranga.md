{% raw %}Akash Dutta works his magic on the piano as he performs three jazz pieces, beginning with a solo piano arrangement of the jazz-samba fusion classic “Spain”, written by piano maestro Chick Corea. He then plays two original compositions. The first is “The Migration,” a through-composed tone poem inspired by the sea-battered coastlines of Wellington and contemporary jazz composers like Avishai Cohen and Tigran Hamasyan. And finally “Typhoon” from his 2020 album Tales of A Traveller, blending Indian classical music and elements of heavy metal with the modalities of post-bop jazz artists such as John Coltrane. <br /><br />Akash Dutta is a jazz pianist and composer based in Wellington and is completing his postgraduate jazz studies at the New Zealand School of Music at Victoria University. His original works span a wide range of genres, from works for solo piano, compositions for radio dramas and film soundtracks <br />Akash is deeply involved in the NZ jazz scene, playing with various ensembles ranging from the NZSM Big Bands to the Wellington Ska Orchestra. Akash's postgraduate work concerns the adaptation of Middle Eastern music into the jazz canon, which is strongly reflected in his music.<br /><br />Web: www.akashdutta.net <br />Spotify:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ToRxxBgCBtvXD5QKeVXac?si=ukQDC_Z3SjiAImM2jxJYLw&amp;dl_branch=1">https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ToRxxBgCBtvXD5QKeVXac?si=ukQDC_Z3SjiAImM2jxJYLw&amp;dl_branch=1</a> <br />ITunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/nz/artist/akash-dutta/1501965561">https://music.apple.com/nz/artist/akash-dutta/1501965561</a> <br /> Akash Dutta is a jazz pianist and composer based in Wellington and is completing his postgraduate jazz studies at the New Zealand School of Music at Victoria University.
