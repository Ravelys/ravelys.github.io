{% raw %}#318 Preview our episodes early and bonus blooper videos! We also jumped on a recorded live stream over the weekend. Check out our Patreon page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SLVPatreon">http://bit.ly/SLVPatreon</a><br /><br />We are roughing it on our impromptu journey up the Western Australian coast. Coffee and fish out of the boot with one burner between 5. But it's pretty great just hanging out on the beach and making do. We're around some great people and some great water. Seriously great water. Up here is teeming with so much life and great dive spots. If you get the chance to come to these parts of WA you honestly won't regret it. It's so worth how long it takes here, it rivals the best of what we've seen in the world and its remoteness is actually a blessing.<br /><br />Also! Stick around for some real talk at the end, we want to share some thoughts with you guys on how we're travelling. <br /><br />Pick up some official La Vaga merch!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop-lavagabonde.com">http://shop-lavagabonde.com</a><br /><br />Check out our website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sailing-lavagabonde.com">http://sailing-lavagabonde.com</a><br /><br />Download Elaynas music here!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://elaynac.bandcamp.com">https://elaynac.bandcamp.com</a><br /><br />Thanks to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SLV-EpidemicSounds">http://bit.ly/SLV-EpidemicSounds</a> and our contributing artists for providing us with great music for this episode<br /><br />Song credits:<br />00:00 - ES_Fresh From Yard - Thompson Town Flowers<br />02:38 - ES_Small Sacrifice - Alfie-Jay Winters<br />05:22 - ES_Kyoto - Bonsaye<br />06:35 - ES_Swirly Bird - Arc De Soleil<br />09:18 - ES_Lavander Fields - Guustavv<br />11:52 - ES_That Something - Jones Meadow<br />14:23 - ES_Midnight Vibe - Yomoti{% endraw %}
