{% raw %}TEDxPatras 2018 | 3.11.2018 | Royal Theater<br /><br />Every period in history is marked by its own special blend of values. Every society develops its own, every single individual or group of people is united by those they have come to accept or, in some cases, reject. Some values are timeless, universal or simply widely accepted, others could be described as contextual or controversial, strictly social, humanitarian or religious.<br /><br />Many positive concepts will be addressed (from a moral, spiritual and materialistic perspective), concepts which are used as the means to measure actions or become the means through which goals are achieved.<br /><br />TEDxPatras 2018 studies them, presents them, sheds light on them, highlights them and questions them. TEDxPatras 2018 publicly addressed which values are vanishing, which are changing and which are standing the test of time. It highlighted whether new values are being created and whether these new ones can adequately replace or complement older ones.<br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tedxpatras">https://www.facebook.com/tedxpatras</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tedx_patras">https://twitter.com/tedx_patras</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tedxpatras/">https://www.instagram.com/tedxpatras/</a><br />Flickr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxpat...">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxpat...</a><br /><br />More about TEDxPatras 2018 at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://2018.tedxpatras.com/.">http://2018.tedxpatras.com/.</a>{% endraw %}
