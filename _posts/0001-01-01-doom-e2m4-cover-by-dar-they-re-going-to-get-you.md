{% raw %}This track is probably one of the most 'haunting' sounding songs in the soundtrack. I wanted to follow the original as close as I could. Introducing some small additions here and there, of course. One such addition being the creepy, rising and falling kind of noise. Originally I thought about doing pick scrapes to make the sound-effect that I wanted. However, after messing around a bit, pick scraping just didn't sound quite right. So on a whim, I decided to do a kind of sawing motion with my pick on the 3 high strings, because &quot;Well, why not?&quot;. Slapped on some delay and light flanger, and it was good to go! That particular noise really reminds me of the sound you hear in a horror movie. Especially when things are building up in the scene. Anyways, I hope you all enjoy the cover! ~DAR<br /><br />MP3 DOWNLOAD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/6dwqsq71dsq24f0/DOOM+-+E2M4+They're+Going+To+Get+You+[Cover+By+Davester2296Covers].mp3">http://www.mediafire.com/download/6dwqsq71dsq24f0/DOOM+-+E2M4+They're+Going+To+Get+You+[Cover+By+Davester2296Covers].mp3</a><br /><br />Next DOOM Cover: &quot;E3M2 - Donna to the Rescue&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ENvvWsSfC6U">https://youtu.be/ENvvWsSfC6U</a><br /><br />Previous DOOM Cover: &quot;E3M1 - Untitled (Hell Keep)&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DYDTH2JDsCk">https://youtu.be/DYDTH2JDsCk</a><br /><br />Mod page and MP3 Packs DOWNLOAD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theofficialdavester2296.wordpress.com/2016/06/26/dars-doom-marathon-music-mod-for-doom-doom-ii/">https://theofficialdavester2296.wordpress.com/2016/06/26/dars-doom-marathon-music-mod-for-doom-doom-ii/</a><br /><br />Doomworld Thread: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/89263-dars-doom-marathon-music-mod/">https://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/89263-dars-doom-marathon-music-mod/</a><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Make sure to Like, Share, and Subscribe if you enjoyed!<br />Follow me at:<br /> (The Den of DAR) Official DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/uEAfRWP">https://discord.gg/uEAfRWP</a><br /><br />DAR's Cover-To-Do List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DowH1EIjiLyeg29cFx-4XOWpr7-bl1Pwb2_OfVaQ1SE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DowH1EIjiLyeg29cFx-4XOWpr7-bl1Pwb2_OfVaQ1SE/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Davester2296/">https://www.facebook.com/Davester2296/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Davester2296">https://twitter.com/Davester2296</a><br />ReverbNation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reverbnation.com/Davester2296">https://www.reverbnation.com/Davester2296</a><br />Originals Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Davester2296">https://www.youtube.com/user/Davester2296</a>{% endraw %}
