{% raw %}One of the biggest questions when vaccines became available was - should long haulers get the jab, and will another mega dose of spike protein make their symptoms better or worse? And if you have a choice, which vaccine should you get?<br /><br />I was one of the first to collect data on the subject, and there were then other studies with bigger sample sizes - but all seemed to show a similar set of results: you’re more likely to feel better than worse after the jab. <br /><br />But what about the longer term effects? What impact did the vaccines have on long haulers now we’ve had more time to assess them? And with a larger sample size, might we see some different results? This film has the answers.<br /><br />In this study, as far as I'm aware the largest of its kind with an n of almost 2,000 - we're going to look at how long haulers reacted to each dose of the vaccine once they recovered from its initial effects, and which vaccine they had - whether it was Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson and Johnson. Which is the best, and least likely to throw a spanner into the -already somewhat spannered - works. <br /><br />CONTENTS:<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:15 The Data<br />2:40 Which is Best Tolerated?<br />5:30 Discussion<br />6:57 Study Info and Limitations{% endraw %}
