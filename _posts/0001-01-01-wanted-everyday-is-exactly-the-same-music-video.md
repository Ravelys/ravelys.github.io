{% raw %}Movie : Wanted<br />Artist : Nine Inch Nails<br />Song : Everyday is Exactly the Same <br /><br />Lyrics :<br /><br />I believe I can see the future<br />Cause I repeat the same routine<br />I think I used to have a purpose<br />But then again<br />That might have been a dream<br />I think I used to have a voice<br />Now I never make a sound<br />I just do what I've been told<br />I really don't want them to come around<br /><br />Oh, no<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />Every day is exactly the same<br />Every day is exactly the same<br />There is no love here and there is no pain<br />Every day is exactly the same<br /><br />I can feel their eyes are watching<br />In case I lose myself again<br />Sometimes I think I'm happy here<br />Sometimes, yet I still pretend<br />I can't remember how this got started<br />But I can tell you exactly how it will end<br /><br />[Chorus]<br /><br />I'm writing on a little piece of paper<br />I'm hoping someday you might find<br />Well I'll hide it behind something<br />They won't look behind<br />I'm still inside here<br />A little bit comes bleeding through<br />I wish this could have been any other way<br />But I just don't know, I don't know what else I can do<br /><br />[Chorus x2]{% endraw %}
