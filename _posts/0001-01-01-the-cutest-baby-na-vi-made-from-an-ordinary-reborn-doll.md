{% raw %}Hi guys! It's time for another transformation. We have already crafted a Neytiri doll, so we can make a baby Na’vi from a Reborn doll, too. <br /><br />The procedure is similar to the previous modifications. First, let's cut this doll's hair. Scissors are the best for it, but, guys, watch your hands! Then we use modeling paste to reshape the nose and head. This paste dries out in the air, so you won't need to use the oven! Na'vi have pointed ears like elves do. We'll shape them and the cute little tail from the paste too. <br /><br />We need to polish all the parts so that the paint spreads out evenly and we can get to the painting. For this, we use an airbrush and bright blue paint. This process is so mesmerizing! Now we only need to add small details. Eyelashes, contrasting lips, and tail. Also, don't forget to draw beautiful dark blue stripes and luminescent marks on the head and body.<br /><br />This baby looks great! See for yourself when you watch our video to the end.
