{% raw %}More information â†’ www.host-bioenergy.com<br /><br />Renewable energy from wood and biomass combustion. How does it work? <br /><br />Approximately 1600 houses in the Dutch district Meerhoven of the city Eindhoven are heated by the wood-fired power plant Meerhoven, turnkey supplied by HoSt. The plant also produces green electricity.<br /><br />These homes are heated by a sustainable district heating network. This network is fed with hot water from the biomass power plant Meerhoven. The biomass comes from the city of Eindhoven. HoSt<br />was responsible for the design, the construction and the commissioning of the plant and also performs the operation and maintenance of the plant.{% endraw %}
