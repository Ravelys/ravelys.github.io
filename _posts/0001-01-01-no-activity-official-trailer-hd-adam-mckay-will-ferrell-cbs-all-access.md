{% raw %}Set over the course of a major drug cartel bust, No Activity follows the misadventures of two low-ranking cops who spend way too much time together; two criminals who are kept in the dark; two dispatch workers who haven't really clicked; and two Mexican tunnelers who get stuck in a space unsuitable for a pair of relative strangers.<br /><br />From comedy titans Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, No Activity is based on the Australian series of the same name,  produced by Jungle. No Activity is produced by CBS Television Studios in association with McKay and Ferrell's production company Gary Sanchez and Funny Or Die. Patrick Brammall, Trent O'Donnell, Jason Burrows, and Joe Farrell will also serve as Executive Producers.{% endraw %}
