{% raw %}Sometimes we need to dig deep to see the gift in life and other times it is right in front of us, yet we may not appreciate it.  It may be simple to see the obvious good in our lives, but it takes a practice of gratitude to recognize the failures as learning opportunities, the limitations as time to grow, the challenges as what build strength and character.  <br /><br />It may come easily to find gratitude for what‚Äôs good in life.  But the true satisfaction and fulfillment comes to those who find gratitude for the obstacles and challenges in life.  When we can change how we look at these challenges, they can become our blessings.<br /><br />Today, we will practice connecting with the good and resonating with the energy of gratitude.  Observe how you can turn the dial of how you feel when you practice gratitude.  Build your own emotional resilience.  <br /><br />Meditation written and read by Sara Raymond<br />Music Credit: The Beauty of Love by Aakash Gandhi from the YouTube Music Library<br /><br />Do not listen while driving.
