{% raw %}Finding meaningful work is all the rage these days, especially among the millennial generation. Of course, this supposes that some work is inherently more meaningful than other work, and doing something that matters is essential to joy, happiness, and fulfillment. <br /><br /><br /><br />But, is meaning something found in work or is it something we bring to our work? <br /><br /><br /><br />Ryan T. Hartwig, PhD, is associate dean of the college of liberal arts and sciences and associate professor of communication at Azusa Pacific University in Greater Los Angeles. His first book, Teams That Thrive: Five Disciplines of Collaborative Church Leadership (with Warren Bird) was recently published by Intervarsity Press.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ryan earned a PhD in communication from the University of Colorado Boulder. His scholarship has been published in the Journal of Applied Communication Research and Group Facilitation, and recognized with several awards from the National Communication Association. Ryan has taught classes in group, organizational and leadership communication for more than ten years, and he has led, trained and developed teams for more fifteen years in universities and churches.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
