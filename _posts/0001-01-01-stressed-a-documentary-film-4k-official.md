{% raw %}A new exploration into emotional stress and exciting science surrounding Neuro Emotional Technique (N.E.T.).  The film delves into our history with stress, how we got to where we are today, and where we go from here.  Featuring Dr. Daniel Monti (Director - Marcus Institute of Integrative Health) and leading neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Newberg (DMT: The Spirit Molecule), we get a fresh perspective on the effects of stress.  Thanks to a new study from the Marcus Institute of Integrative Health at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA, there is now compelling evidence that this breakthrough intervention can help people to alleviate their emotional stress, as well as deeper insight into this exciting topic.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stresseddoc.com/">https://stresseddoc.com/</a>{% endraw %}
