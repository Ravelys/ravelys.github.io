It is very important to forgive those who have caused you harm because hanging on to the suffering and upset is only hurting yourself. But what about those who we need to apologise too. Knowing we caused harm and not being able to apologize because the doors of communication have been closed, or its just too difficult can also hurt our bodies, minds and spirit.<br /><br />Being forgiven is often overlooked, as not being as important as forgiving another. Both are very important but you can only control forgiving, because it is an action you can take. While the other person holds the key to forgive you, an action you can only request. Being forgiven starts with asking, and that is what we do in this meditation, we ask.<br /><br />We call forth a personâ€™s spirit we need to ask forgiveness from, in this simple powerful meditation. On a subconscious level the person knows you are apologising because their spirit is present. Often this opens the door to forgiveness and communication in your active life. Of course you may not wish to have communication due to the reciprocated harm, but at least you are beginning the healing process. Also communication in the present may be impossible because the person has passed making this meditation even more important for you.<br /><br />All meditations provided are done with prayers of protection and closing with the 23rd psalm as taught by Edgar Cayce in his lifetime. Although these meditations are short, they are very profound. This meditation may leave you slightly altered, so please do not drive or go to work immediately after completing this simple guided meditation. Be sure you are fully aware before moving forward with your day.<br /><br />Schedule a Spiritual Psychic Reading today at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://intointuition.com/spiritual-psychic-reading/">https://intointuition.com/spiritual-psychic-reading/</a><br /><br />Get our free list of intuitive gifts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://intointuition.com/the8intuiti...">https://intointuition.com/the8intuiti...</a><br /> <br />Give yourself 10 minutes to:<br />Build your strength<br />Support your spirit<br />Find peace<br />Be calmer<br />and So Much More!<br /><br />Best selling author and international speaker, Nora Truscello provides a daily 10 minute mediation.
