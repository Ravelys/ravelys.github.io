{% raw %}The dads speak on the importance of accountability in fatherhood. Marvin Sapp mentions that fathers need to not only be accountable for their own actions, but also for their children. Master P agrees, saying that children hold you accountable for everything that you do, so it is imperative to make sure that you are doing the right thing. Derek Luke mentions that as a father, “you are the only one that can really hold yourself accountable.” Tune in to the OWN Spotlight event They Call Me Dad on Tuesday, Sep. 14th, only on OWN. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1vqD1PN">http://bit.ly/1vqD1PN</a><br /><br /><br /><br />About OWN:<br /><br />Oprah Winfrey Network is the first and only network named for, and inspired by, a single iconic leader.
