{% raw %}In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.<br /><br />I discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional &quot;blinks&quot; (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD). <br /><br />The role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors:<br />Roka - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roka.com">https://www.roka.com</a> -- code &quot;huberman&quot;<br />Belcampo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.belcampo.com/huberman">https://www.belcampo.com/huberman</a><br />Helix Sleep - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman">https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Support Research in the Huberman Lab at Stanford:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving">https://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving</a><br /><br />Social:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br />Join Newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network">https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network</a><br /><br />Links:<br />Review of Compounds for ADHD, Smart Drugs &amp; Focus - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fbscience.com/Landmark/articles/10.52586/4948">https://www.fbscience.com/Landmark/articles/10.52586/4948</a><br />Review of Atypical Compounds for ADHD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2016/1320423/">https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2016/1320423/</a><br />Study of Focus Protocol In ADHD &amp; Non-ADHD Children - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4780">https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4780</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00:00 Introduction &amp; Note About Diagnosis<br />00:03:27 Sponsors <br />00:07:56 ADHD vs. ADD: Genetics, IQ, Rates in Kids &amp; Adults<br />00:13:00 Attention &amp; Focus, Impulse Control<br />00:14:57 Hyper-focus <br />00:16:45 Time Perception<br />00:18:25 The Pile System<br />00:20:00 Working Memory<br />00:24:10 Hyper-Focus &amp; Dopamine <br />00:26:40 Neural Circuits In ADHD: Default Mode Network &amp; Task-Related Networks <br />00:32:57 Low Dopamine in ADHD &amp; Stimulant Use &amp; Abuse<br />00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil <br />00:47:00 Non-Prescribed Adderall, Caffeine, Nicotine<br />00:49:18 How Stimulants “Teach” the Brains of ADHD Children to Focus<br />00:52:00 When To Medicate: A Highly Informed (Anecdotal) Case Study<br />00:56:35 Elimination Diets &amp; Allergies In ADHD<br />01:04:46 Omega-3 Fatty Acids: EPAs &amp; DHAs <br />01:07:00 Modulation vs Mediation of Biological Processes<br />01:10:50 Attentional Blinks <br />01:16:56 Open Monitoring &amp; 17 minute Focus Enhancement <br />01:22:50 Blinking, Dopamine &amp; Time Perception; &amp; Focus Training <br />01:30:10 Reverberatory Neural &amp; Physical Activity<br />01:33:40 Adderall, Ritalin &amp; Blink Frequency<br />01:35:00 Cannabis <br />01:37:30 Interoceptive Awareness <br />01:41:15 Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil; Smart Drugs &amp; Caffeine: Dangers<br />01:48:05 DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine<br />01:50:54 Ginko Biloba <br />01:51:45 Modafinil &amp; Armodafanil: Dopamine Action &amp; Orexin<br />01:56:19 Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC<br />01:59:04 L-Tyrosine, (PEA) Phenylethylamine <br />02:01:23 Racetams, Noopept <br />02:05:15 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Combining Technology &amp; Pharmacology <br />02:09:14 Smart Phones &amp; ADHD &amp; Sub-Clinical Focus Issues In Adults &amp; Kids<br />02:14:30 Synthesis/Summary<br />02:16:10 Support for Podcast &amp; Research, Supplement Resources<br /><br /><br />Please note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.
