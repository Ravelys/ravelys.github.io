NO<br />🌏Where are you from? Tel-Aviv, Israel (I speak Hebrew)<br />❓ How did you lose your accent? I learned acting in NYC and acquired an #AmericanAccent. So I never really lost anything;)  I talk about it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PShZ9s">https://goo.gl/PShZ9s</a><br />🤔 How can I speak like a native speaker? <br />First, you need to decide what your goals are. Are you looking to lose your accent so people won’t recognize that you’re not a native speaker? Or you simply want to speak with clarity and confidence?<br />Whatever it is, you need to know that a foreign accent is not a bad thing. It's a part of your identity. Of who you are. Your goal should be to sound clear and get people to do what you want them to do. You want to feel confident in your English voice so that you never let your English hold you back or prevent you from achieving your goals. Aiming to ‘speak like a native' creates an unfair expectation of yourself and can make you feel like you’re never good enough. #CommunicationOverPerfection #speaklikeyourself<br /><br />At the same time, there’s a lot you can do to sound clearer and understand better the sounds of American English, pronunciation and intonation. <br /><br />This is where I can help.

So the focus is on getting the right answers, and how it ‘should’ be rather than understanding the challenges we face as nonnative speakers. <br /><br />🇺🇸Do native speakers think you are American? <br />They usually do. But later in the conversation, they may detect a subtle accent. It depends on what I'm talking about and how tired I am. I don't care about it too much though, I'm a proud non-native speaker ✊<br />🇮🇱🇵🇸What do you think about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? I think land is not worth dying or fighting for. I will always promote peace and co-existence. And for me, communication in English is a way to overcome political and cultural barriers. <br />🎓How can I learn with you? <br />I don’t coach 1:1 anymore, but you can join my signature program.
