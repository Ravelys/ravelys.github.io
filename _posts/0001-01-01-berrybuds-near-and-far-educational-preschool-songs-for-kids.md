{% raw %}Berrybuds - Near and Far - Preschool songs for kids - NEW episode!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3qyHhvY‚Äã‚Äã">https://bit.ly/3qyHhvY‚Äã‚Äã</a> - Subscribe! <br />In this episode-song, the Berry Buds learn about the difference between far and near. If you see and hear something well and can reach it easily then it‚Äôs near. When something is far, you can‚Äôt touch it easily, it sounds quiet and looks really small! In this episode, the Berry Buds also get a toy pet ‚Äì a cute ginger kitten!<br />In the hand-crafted green world of Berryland live three round characters: cheerful Haha, kind Mimi and shy Bubu.<br />In every episode, they learn to play together, be friends, and find ways out of different situations.<br />The kind Nanny (voice-over) gives them clues to finding their own solutions with her cheerful songs.<br />The Nanny acts like an off-screen Mary Poppins for Berry Buds. Her songs are an important part of Berryland.<br />The little Berry Buds have little kids‚Äô problems: someone is too tired to play, or has got hurt and feels sad, or is too shy to make friends with somebody.<br />The Nanny knows that these little problems are actually quite big for our little heroes.<br />She helps the Berry Buds to overcome sadness, confusion and other unpleasant feelings singing her kind children‚Äôs songs.<br />Sometimes, she is simply cheerful and plays with them to the music.<br />The songs are very simple and easy to memorize. And they are fun to dance to! Except for lullabies, of course. Those are for going to bed... üò¥<br />shorturl.at/CFHN4 - –ö—Ä—É–≥–ª—è—à–∏ - –≤—Å–µ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Ä—è–¥! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PDxWnM‚Äã‚Äã">https://bit.ly/2PDxWnM‚Äã‚Äã</a> - –ö—Ä—É–≥–ª—è—à–∏ - –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å—ã–≤–∞–π—Å—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—à –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª!<br />shorturl.at/fCHKO - –ö—Ä—É–≥–ª—è—à–∏ - —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫–∏ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–π! <br />–ö—Ä—É–≥–ª—è—à–∏ - –º—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –¥–ª—è –º–∞–ª—ã—à–µ–π{% endraw %}
