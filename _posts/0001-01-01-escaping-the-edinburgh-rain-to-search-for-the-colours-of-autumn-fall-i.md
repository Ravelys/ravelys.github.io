{% raw %}October was a terrible month for weather here in Scotland - rain rain rain, but even though the forecast for today was awful, we still headed out to see if we could cobble together some kind of video for you in a month that has otherwise been a write-off!  Will we find ANY dry weather? And more importantly, will the colours of autumn (colors of fall) :) show us their full glory? Probably not...<br /><br />Filmed on Thursday 28th October 2021.<br /><br />For more info on Ossian's Hall, check out the following links. Interesting place with a stunning location, I'm not surprised it's so popular for wedding photos!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossian%27s_Hall_of_Mirrors">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossian%27s_Hall_of_Mirrors</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-hermitage/highlights/ossians-hall">https://www.nts.org.uk/visit/places/the-hermitage/highlights/ossians-hall</a><br /><br />Hi, I’m Steve.
