{% raw %}A ballad of the human condition; &quot;Belief&quot; finds Mayer struggling with man's need to imbue the existence of our kind with a doctrine of unalterable and stonewalled faith. It's gut-wrenchingly poignant lyrics like - &quot;What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand? Belief can... What puts a folded flag inside his mother's hand? Belief can...&quot; - which proves that Mayer is one of the most inspired singer/songwriters of our time, bar none.{% endraw %}
