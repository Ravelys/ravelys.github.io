{% raw %}(Sorry this is hard to listen to with the poor recording/instrument quality. I had no equipment other than a camera and a laptop. But I liked the song when I wrote it, so I thought I'd share it somehow regardless. I had no mic for the singing, so the words are hard to understand. Lyrics below.)<br /><br />This song is about the reason we're made the way we're made  -- so that we could have a little better understanding of the One who made us.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />I get caught up in the wanting most every day,<br /><br />Wanting someone to take the ache away.<br /><br />Wanting someone to look at me that way.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />But no man could give me what I really need.<br /><br />Someone to see the flower inside the seed.<br /><br />Someone tender with such a shaken and bruised reed.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br /><br /><br />(Chorus:) Still there's this hunger that drives us all on and on.<br /><br />Does it have to be so strong?<br /><br />Could it be because we have all strayed and gone,<br /><br />And this hunger in part, <br /><br />Helps to show us Your heart,<br /><br />And the way that we long, <br /><br />That's how You long.<br /><br />For us.<br /><br />For me.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br /><br /><br />You know how it feels to feel all alone,<br /><br />No dozen roses for me as a means of love shown<br /><br />Except the One who made them all,<br /><br />Wants me for His own.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />How could someone know You without loving You?<br /><br />When You know me through and through,<br /><br />Yet You love me through and through.<br /><br />Known and loved from the inside point of view.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />(Chorus)<br /><br />The most romantic thing that a man could ever do,<br /><br />Would be to take the bullet for the one who<br /><br />Who he loves like no other, who he loves true.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />But isn't that just what You did for Your bride<br /><br />So one day in white she could stand by Your side,<br /><br />And You've made her clean with nothing to hide.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />That's irresistible.<br /><br />(Chorus){% endraw %}
