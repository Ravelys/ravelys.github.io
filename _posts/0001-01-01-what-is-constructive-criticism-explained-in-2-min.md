First one says that the presentation was bad. You can simply discard this as there is no value.<br />Second manager says that your presentation was weak, because your planner presentation time was 30 min, but your presentation was 45 minute. And you only covered 3 points out of 4.<br />This is Constructive Criticism and you have to take it on board so that you can improve the next time.<br />If you want to learn how to give Constructive Criticism then here are some strategies for you:<br />First - Use a feedback sandwich. Instead of just telling a person what went wrong you can start with a positive point, then deliver Constructive Criticism and finish off with another positive thing.<br />Second - Focus on the situation and not the person. This will make your criticism less personal and easier to process.<br />Third - Be Specific. Instead of being broad and saying that work done poorly you can be specific and mention delivery time, volume or depth of it.<br />Fourth - Suggest improvement. If you know how a person can improve then give them suggestions so they can improve quicker.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Constructive Criticism is and how to give Constructive Criticism to others.     <br />_________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
