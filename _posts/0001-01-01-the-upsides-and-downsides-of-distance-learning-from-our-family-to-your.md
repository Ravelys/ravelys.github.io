{% raw %}In this episode of From our Family to Yours, hear Jennifer's perspective on distance learning. <br /><br />Both of Jennifer's children have learning and thinking differences, but her son has adapted to distance learning much better than her daughter. While her son is thriving, her daughter needs constant support, which is hard to do with her own demanding work schedule. <br /><br />Jennifer also is balancing trying to share technology, since they do not have access to a personal computer for each member of the family. <br /><br />It is important to remember that as a parent, you are sometimes limited on how much you can do for your children. Prioritize their educational needs, but also remember that it is sometimes impossible to check every box. <br /><br />Need help with distance learning?
