{% raw %}Hello friend. I will be uploading my favorite Mr. Robot scenes from Season 1 and Season 2, starting with this incredible opening from the season finale. In this scene we get the (maybe) first glimpse of Elliot as Mr. Robot talking with Tyrell about working together.<br /><br />This video was uploaded solely for entertainment purposes and I have no intent on profiting off of it.<br />All right belong to USA Network and the show's creator Sam Esmail. Thank you for this wonderful show.{% endraw %}
