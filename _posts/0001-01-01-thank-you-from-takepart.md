{% raw %}In 2009, Participant Media founded TakePart.com with the belief that a story well told can change the world. For the last eight years, we have done just that. Over the years, we built a community of over 4 million dedicated fans like yourself who have helped take over 20 million actions on our site.<br /> <br />As the digital landscape evolves, Participant recognized it, too, must evolve. For that reason, TakePart is ceasing operations.<br /> <br />But while the site is shutting down, we’re not done fighting to change the world. Participant remains dedicated to addressing the world's most pressing issues and we are excited to share that we’re unveiling something new in 2017.
