{% raw %}Brad Pitt takes no prisoners in Quentin Tarantino's high-octane WWII revenge fantasy Inglourious Basterds. As war rages in Europe, a Nazi-scalping squad of American soldiers, known to their enemy as 'The Basterds,' is on a daring mission to take down the leaders of the Third Reich. Bursting with 'action, hair-trigger suspense and a machine-gun spray of killer dialogue' (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone), Inglourious Basterds is 'another Tarantino masterpiece' (Jake Hamilton, CBS-TV)!{% endraw %}
