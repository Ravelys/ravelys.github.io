{% raw %}We really enjoyed giving these Darlings a pleasant #surprise by going the extra mile and showing up in front of their doorsteps as #bike #delivery girls! <br /><br />During our chikahan sessions, they have shared their own stories, personal reasons and motivations on why they ride their bikes and we are very grateful that they willingly opened up to us. <br /><br />Despite the hot weather, sunburnt arms and thighs, unexpected turn of events since this was a surprise, we’d do it all over again just to get to know one Darling at a time who have helped us spread positivity in the cycling community. <br /><br />And of course, we would like to commend all delivery personnel out there whom we consider our modern day heroes who ensure our lunch for the day, our groceries or add-to-cart budol finds from online stores are delivered on time. <br /><br />Though we really enjoyed being delivery girls for 2 straight mornings, it’s a lot of hard work. We truly appreciate your dedication and passion for putting our needs and wants first before your safety. SALUDO KAMI SA INYONG LAHAT! <br /><br />#womenonbikes #womencycling #salsa #cyclinggirl #touringbike #gravelbike #allroadbike #gravel #biketouring #biketour #bikeadventures #cyclingadventures #couplecyling #travel #wanderlust<br /><br /><br /><br />Hello, Darlings! We are Levi and Sara, a #pride couple since 2011 who loves to discover unique places and meet different kinds of people by just using our bikes. Our passion started in 2017 in Japan where used city bikes to commute. This gave us an idea to also do the same back home. But the short city rides in our foldies turned into longer journeys going to different towns and it eventually became our lifestyle. We wish to inspire more people to get on their saddles, get moving and ALWAYS ENJOY THE RIDE!{% endraw %}
