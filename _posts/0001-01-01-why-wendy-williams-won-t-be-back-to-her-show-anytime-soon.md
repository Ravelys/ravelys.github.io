{% raw %}Wendy Williams will not be on her show when the new season premieres next week. It was announced that the talk-show host is not ready to be on camera due to “ongoing medical conditions.” Back in September, 57-year-old Wendy was diagnosed with a breakthrough case of COVID-19. The last time she was seen in public she was running errands around New York City and getting into a wheelchair. The show says she will be back “as soon as she’s ready.”{% endraw %}
