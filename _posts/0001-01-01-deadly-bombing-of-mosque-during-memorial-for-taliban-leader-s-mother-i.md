An Italian-funded emergency hospital said it is treating four other people who were injured in the blast. It was the first major attack in Kabul since a suicide bombing at the city’s airport in August while US-led forces were evacuating. Sunday’s bombing targeted the Eidgah Mosque, where a memorial service was being held for the mother of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. Three suspects were reportedly arrested nearby. There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but the Taliban said that after the attack it launched an operation against a sleeper cell of Islamic State Khorasan (Isis-K), the Isis affiliate in Afghanistan.
