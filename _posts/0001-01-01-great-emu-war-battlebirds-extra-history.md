After WW1, soldiers were offered land but honestly the land is both poor in quality and in some cases, stolen from the Aboriginese. The Great Depression slams into the country, meaning promises of fair pay for what wheat could be grown disappear into thin air. Western Australia is starting to murmer about independence from the rest of the country. And to top it all off, 20,000 emus have decended upon Campion. Senator George Pearce has an idea. Allow Western Australians to fight off the emus using weapons of war, film it for big spectacle, and reap the credit for helping in a time of crisis. What could go wrong?<br /><br />___________<br /><br />Support the people who make this show, vote for future Extra History topics, and get great perks at our Patreon! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/EHPatreon">http://bit.ly/EHPatreon</a> <br /><br />Subscribe &amp; ! to our channel on YouTube at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubToEC">http://bit.ly/SubToEC</a><br />Got more info about Extra Credits on our website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://extracredits.site/">http://extracredits.site/</a><br />Grab your Extra Credits gear at the store! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://extracredits.store/">http://extracredits.store/</a><br />___________<br /><br />Thanks for participating in this week's discussion!
