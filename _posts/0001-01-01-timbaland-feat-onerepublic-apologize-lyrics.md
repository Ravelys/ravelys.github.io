OneRepublic - Apologize ðŸŽµ<br /><br />I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground<br />And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound<br />You tell me that you need me then you go and cut me down, but wait<br />You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around, and say (that)<br /><br />It's too late to apologize (it's too late).<br />I said, &quot;It's too late to apologize (it's too late).<br /><br />I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you<br />And I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothin' new (yeah)<br />I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue, and you say,<br />Sorry, like the angel heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid...<br /><br />It's too late to apologize (it's too late).<br />I said, &quot;It's too late to apologize (it's too late).<br /><br />It's too late to apologize (it's too late).<br />I said, &quot;It's too late to apologize (it's too late).<br /><br />I said, &quot;It's too late to apologize,&quot; yeah (too late)<br />I said, &quot;It's too late to apologize,&quot; yeah (too late)<br /><br />I'm holdin' on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground<br /><br />Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br /><br />#Timbaland #OneRepublic #Apologize #Awelyrics #apologizelyrics #music #lyrics #songs{% endraw %}
