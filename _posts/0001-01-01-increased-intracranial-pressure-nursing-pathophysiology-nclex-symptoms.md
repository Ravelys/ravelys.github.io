{% raw %}Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) nursing, pathophysiology, NCLEX, treatment, and symptoms NCLEX review.<br /><br />Increased intracranial pressure occurs when the inside of the skull experiences increased pressure. This is a medical emergency! <br /><br />How is ICP created? Intracranial pressure is the pressure created by the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue/blood within the skull. It can be measured in the lateral ventricles with an external ventricular drain (ventriculostomy).<br /><br />What is a normal intracranial pressure (ICP)? 5-15 mmHg  (greater than 20 mmHg…needs treatment) <br /><br />Pathophysiology of increased intracranial pressure: The human skull is very hard and is limited on how much it can expand when something inside the skull experiences a change that leads to increased pressure exerted within the skull.<br /><br />Inside the skull are three structures that can alter intracranial pressure: brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and blood.<br /><br />The Monro-Kellie hypothesis deals with how ICP is affected by CSF, brain's blood, and tissue that works to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). In a nutshell, this hypothesis says that when the volume of one of these structures increases than the others will have to decrease their volume to compensate for the increased intracranial pressure.<br /><br />Intracranial pressure fluctuates and this depends on many factors like: the person’s body temperature, oxygenation status, especially CO2 and O2 levels, body position, arterial and venous pressure, anything that increases intra-abdominal or thoracic pressure (vomiting, bearing down). <br /><br />Cerebral perfusion pressure is important when dealing with intracranial pressure. A normal CPP is 60-100 mmHg. <br /><br />When CPP (pressure that pushes the blood to the brain) falls too low the brain is not perfused and brains tissue dies. <br /><br />How is CPP calculated?<br />CPP= MAP - ICP (see video on how to calculate cerebral perfusion pressure)<br /><br />Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure: mental status changes (EARLIEST), cushing's triad, vomiting, headache, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, optic and oculomotor nerve damage, abnormal doll's eye, seizures etc.<br /><br />Nursing care for increased ICP includes monitoring and preventing further increases in intracranial pressure, administering drugs such as Mannitol, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids etc. See video for a mnemonic on the nursing interventions for increased ICP.<br /><br />Increased Intracranial Pressure NCLEX Questions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.registerednursern.com/increased-intracranial-pressure-icp-nclex-questions/">https://www.registerednursern.com/increased-intracranial-pressure-icp-nclex-questions/</a><br /><br />Notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.registerednursern.com/increased-intracranial-pressure-icp-nclex-review/">https://www.registerednursern.com/increased-intracranial-pressure-icp-nclex-review/</a><br /><br />More Neuro Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfVPDxuXWcpmg42nNXdjA9FD">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfVPDxuXWcpmg42nNXdjA9FD</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RegisteredNurseRNs">https://www.facebook.com/RegisteredNurseRNs</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/registerednursern_com/">https://www.instagram.com/registerednursern_com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=registerednursern">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=registerednursern</a><br /><br />Nursing School Supplies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.registerednursern.com/the-ultimate-list-of-nursing-medical-supplies-and-items-a-new-nurse-student-nurse-needs-to-buy/">http://www.registerednursern.com/the-ultimate-list-of-nursing-medical-supplies-and-items-a-new-nurse-student-nurse-needs-to-buy/</a><br /><br />Popular Playlists:<br /><br />NCLEX Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfWtwCDmLHyX2UeHofCIcgo0">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfWtwCDmLHyX2UeHofCIcgo0</a><br />Fluid &amp;
