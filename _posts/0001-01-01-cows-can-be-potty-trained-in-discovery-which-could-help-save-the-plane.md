{% raw %}Cows are being ‘potty trained’ to help cut down greenhouse gas emissions<br /><br />Controlling where they pee reduces emissions of ammonia.<br /><br />Researchers found they learn the habit quicker than a human toddler.<br /><br />Stalls called MooLoos prompt calves to relieve themselves for treats.<br /><br />Animal psychologist Dr Jan Langbein said: &quot;It's usually assumed cattle are not capable of controlling defecation or urination.<br /><br />&quot;Cattle, like many other animals or farm animals, are quite clever and they can learn a lot.<br /><br />&quot;Why shouldn't they be able to learn how to use a toilet?&quot;<br /><br />Cows freely relieve themselves as they graze,  often contaminating local soil and waterways.<br /><br />They are sometimes confined to barns but in close quarters the urine and faeces combine to create ammonia.<br /><br />The study shows they can be toilet-trained, enabling waste to be collected and treated.<br /><br />It keeps barns clean, cuts air pollution and leads to more open, animal-friendly farms.<br /><br />Subscribe to The Telegraph on YouTube ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3idrdLH">https://bit.ly/3idrdLH</a><br /><br />Get the latest headlines: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Telegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.{% endraw %}
