You try to find sense, <br />In the labor it takes to go up. <br />There is this breathtaking view, <br />Once you've made it to the top.<br /><br /><br />This is the calm before the storm.<br />This is the calm before the storm.<br /><br /><br />And you were quite a lot alone, <br />Fighting with yourself <br />And counting white clouds in the dark. <br />Chasing storms!<br />Finally reaching it,<br />But there's a silence in your heart!<br />There's a silence in your heart.<br /><br /><br />This is the calm before the storm,<br />This is the calm before the storm.<br /><br /><br />And you were quite a lot alone!<br />But now you're finally chasing storms!<br /><br />And you were quite a lot alone!<br />But now you're finally chasing storms!<br /><br /><br />Every time the doorbell rings,<br />You hold me back!<br /><br /><br />Website &amp; Social Media <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youthokay.com/">https://youthokay.com/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/youthokay">https://www.facebook.com/youthokay</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/youthokay">https://www.instagram.com/youthokay</a> <br /><br />#youthokay #quitealotalone #depression{% endraw %}
