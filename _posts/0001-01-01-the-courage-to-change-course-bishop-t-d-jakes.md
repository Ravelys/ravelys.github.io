{% raw %}Until we ask God for the courage to cut, cast out, and challenge our mistakes, we won‚Äôt be able to change course. In Genesis 21, Abraham was living with his mistake and miracle in the same house. He had a crossroad decision to make: Cast Ishmael and the bondwoman out now, or arrive short of destiny. Have you been too worried about the disruption change causes that you never cut loose the people who have delayed your destiny? Somebody always gets hurt in the cutting, but if you don't move, it might end up being you. Don‚Äôt rob your destiny of the temporary discomfort of changing course! <br /><br />Message: ‚ÄúThe Courage to Change Course‚Äù <br />Scripture: Genesis 21:4-14 (KJV) <br />Speaker: Bishop T.D.
