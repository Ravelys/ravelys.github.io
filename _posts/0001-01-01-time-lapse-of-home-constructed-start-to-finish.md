{% raw %}A time lapse project of a custom home built by Weaver Homes -- a division of Weaver Companies, Inc.  Original footage was captured at 1 photo every 30 seconds over a 6 month period resulting in 45 days of capture and over 70,000 photos.  Images we edited in Adobe Lightroom 3, combined in Quicktime Pro at 30 frames/sec and compiled in iMovie 11.  Most clips were then sped up by 200-400% to produce this short movie.  Enjoy!{% endraw %}
