{% raw %}Event: Columbia University Libraries' Data Visualization Week: The Art of Data Visualization<br />Hosted by: Columbia University's Science and Engineering Library<br /><br />The practice of data visualization rests on visual disambiguation. Information graphics employ solid lines, defined shapes, and familiar approaches to dividing up a plane that assume the stability of the represented data. More often than not, however, the data itself is mutable, imperfect, and more prone to interpretation than it appears. This talk will address the risks of adopting certain visual conventions, the implications of specific visual methods, and some practical approaches toward ensuring transparency and accountability in data visualization.{% endraw %}
