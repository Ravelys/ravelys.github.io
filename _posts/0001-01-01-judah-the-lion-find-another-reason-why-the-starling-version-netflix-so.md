{% raw %}“Find Another Reason Why (The Starling Version)” from The Starling (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film)<br />Music by Judah and the Lion<br />Listen to the soundtrack here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundtracks.lnk.to/thestarlingAW">https://soundtracks.lnk.to/thestarlingAW</a> <br /><br />ABOUT JUDAH AND THE LION:<br />Judah &amp; the Lion has been a family unto itself since forming at Nashville’s Belmont  University in 2011. Judah was from nearby Cookeville, an aspiring baseball player with a secret love for folk guitar. Brian, from Chicagoland, was mostly obsessed with piano. Coloradan Nate was a son of symphony players but preferred metal. Their differences were their strength as they crafted their sound over a bluegrass heavy  debut, Kids These Days  and a mold breaking follow up, Folk Hop n’ Roll, both produced by Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) and made in two weeks. In 2017, their triumphant “Take It All Back” topped the alternative songs chart for three weeks in a row, paving the way for a Best New Rock/Alternative Artist win at the 2018 iHeartRadio Awards. While many of Pep Talks’ songs were written on the bus immediately after the band’s famously high energy shows at various festivals and on tours with Twenty One Pilots, Incubus, Jimmy Eat World, and Kaleo the boys co-produced and recorded this LP over three inspired months with help from boundary busting friends like Darren King, Jon Bellion, and Kacey Musgraves.<br /><br />ABOUT THE STARLING: <br />After Lilly (Melissa McCarthy) suffers a loss, a battle with a territorial bird (The Starling) over dominion of her garden provides an unlikely avenue for her grief and the courage to heal her relationships and rediscover her capacity for love.<br /><br />THE STARLING (Soundtrack from the Netflix Film)<br />TRACKLISTING - <br />1.
