Hardly! Our neuron-dense brains have evolved to use the least amount of energy while carrying the most information possible -- a feat that requires the entire brain. Richard E. Cytowic debunks this neurological myth (and explains why we aren't so good at multitasking).<br /><br />Lesson by Richard E. Cytowic, animation by TOGETHER.{% endraw %}
