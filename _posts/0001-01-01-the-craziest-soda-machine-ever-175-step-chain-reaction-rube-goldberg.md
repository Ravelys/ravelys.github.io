I build these things all the time.<br />So this is the most complicated and coolest way to get your coca-cola. This is the most insane project I've worked on in my entire YouTube career. I spent 140 hours (over 3 months) in total putting this video, under four minutes, together. This coke dispenser failed 114 times before I finally got it to work. <br />In case you don't notice, there are several second angles in this machine. These were all filmed later to cover up early jumps in the video, and things that the first camera did not cover. IT DID WORK IN ONE TRY. If you are interested in exactly how it fell, this is the single shot version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-zY-WJ8tqww">https://youtu.be/-zY-WJ8tqww</a><br />To my subscribers - thanks guys for sticking with me even though I uploaded a lot less trying to get this together. You guys are the best :D<br />There are 175 steps and many of them are multi-use elements so I hope that it looks cool enough. Happy new year everyone, and looking forward to a great 2016!<br />-Berlagawesome<br /><br />Music: Itro - Yeah{% endraw %}
