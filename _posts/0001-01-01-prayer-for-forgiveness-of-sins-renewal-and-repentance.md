put together where I would like to pray for anyone within the sound of my voice. <br /><br />All I ask you to do is to agree with me as we seek our Heavenly Father.<br /><br />Please continue to meditate on this prayer for yourself. <br /><br />Speak it daily or listen to this video over and over again and allow the Word of God concerning forgiveness, renewal, and repentance of sins to reach deep into your spirit.<br /><br />Let us pray...<br /><br />Heavenly Father, we gather together here online and come into agreement in the wonderful and powerful name of Jesus. <br /><br />Where two or more are gathered there You shall surely be and anything we agree upon as touching You will surely do.<br /><br />The Bible says that if there is any unforgiveness that it should be dealt with before praying.<br /><br />Therefore we release any anger, bad feelings, resentment or any other wrong attitude before You now...<br /><br />We declare in agreement that Jesus is Lord over the listener and if they believe in their heart that You raised Him from the dead they will be saved with Heaven being their eternal home.<br /><br />We receive it Father and praise You.<br /><br />Help the listenerâ€™s unbelief.<br /><br />Their slate is wiped clean right now.<br /><br />In the face of any feeling of guilt and unworthiness, the listener receives their forgiveness.<br /><br />The guilt is leaving and the sin is removed because of Your love for them.<br /><br />You have forgiven their sins.<br /><br />It is not about what they do or donâ€™t do, it is by grace through faith that they have forgiveness.<br /><br />They cannot earn it but You have freely given forgiveness to them because they asked!<br /><br />Praise the Lord.<br /><br />Renew them right now by Your Spirit.<br /><br />We speak refreshing over their mind, will, emotions, and body right now in Jesus Name.<br /><br />You, Father, are holding nothing against them.<br /><br />You, Father, are not holding anything back from them.<br /><br />You chose the listener in Christ before the foundation of the world that they should be holy and blameless in Your sight.<br /><br />Thanks be to You.<br /><br />In Jesus they have redemption, deliverance, and salvation through His blood, the remission (forgiveness) of their offenses (shortcomings and trespasses), in accordance with the riches and the generosity of Your gracious favor. <br /><br />Father, the listener has received Your Son, Jesus.<br /><br />They believe in His name.<br /><br />Through Jesus You have given them the right to become Your child.<br /><br />Thank You for forgiving them and absolving them of all guilt. <br /><br />They are more than conquerors through the blood of Jesus.<br /><br />They are set free from the past in Jesus Name.<br /><br />Thank You Lord!<br /><br />In Jesus Name.<br /><br />Amen.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Scriptures:<br /><br />John 14:26<br />Psalm 119:130<br />Jer 1:12<br />James 4:8<br
