{% raw %}The Institute of Public Affairs' Gideon Rozner says nowadays to be a journalist one only needs &quot;an internet connection and something to say&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;Now what you are seeing with social media is the rise of citizen journalism and small independent journalistic outlets,&quot; he told Sky News host Cory Bernardi. <br /><br />&quot;Nowadays you just need an internet connection and something to say. <br /><br />&quot;And we as consumers of the news have more power than ever before to choose where we get our news and current affairs information from.&quot;{% endraw %}
