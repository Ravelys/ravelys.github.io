{% raw %}This is what I have been doing recently. I started playing Minecraft Bedwars and never got bored, so I decided to make a montage video with some kills and also some funny moments.<br /><br />I might start a new challenge on Minecraft soon, but I don't really know when it will be over / when will the video be uploaded.<br /><br />The music used is not composed by me. I do not own any songs in any form or shape.<br /><br />Music used:<br />Action Sports - Bobby Cole<br />Jeff Broadbent - Final Battle<br />Fighting off the Invasion - Terraria Otherworld OST<br />War Drums<br />Phantom - Zac Nelson<br />Flames of War - Ihor Vitsinskyy<br />Rob McAllister - Heist Prep Montage<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Don't forget to like and subscribe :)<br /><br />#Minecraft #Bedwars #Phantasm{% endraw %}
