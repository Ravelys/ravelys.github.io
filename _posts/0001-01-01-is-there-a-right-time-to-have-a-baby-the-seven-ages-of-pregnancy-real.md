{% raw %}Cherry Healey’s life couldn’t have been better, her TV career was taking off, she landed herself a great flat and a cool boyfriend. She was the happiest 27 year old she knew. Then she found out she was pregnant<br /><br />This was NOT part of her life plan. But this got her thinking “Is there ever a right time to have a baby?” With just 7 weeks to go before she drops, Cherry is off to find the answer. She’s going to meet seven pregnant women all at very different stages of their lives – the 15 year old school girl mum, the high flier with a C –section scheduled into her Blackberry, the desperate 40-something IVF patient – all of who will hopefully help her understand the fundamental change she is about to go through from young, free and single to somebody’s mum.<br /><br /><br />Real Families brings you stories of modern day family life from around the world through the eyes of children, parents, and parenting experts. <br />Subscribe for weekly documentaries and full episodes of evergreen family documentaries and parenting TV shows. <br /> <br />Subscribe for more from Real Families: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/y8WzCa">https://goo.gl/y8WzCa</a><br /> <br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RealFamilies/">https://www.facebook.com/RealFamilies/</a><br /> <br />Check us out on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/realfamilieschannel/">https://www.instagram.com/realfamilieschannel/</a><br /> <br />We’re on TikTok too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@realfamilies">https://www.tiktok.com/@realfamilies</a><br /><br /><br />Content licensed from Warner Brothers.<br /><br />Produced by Renegade Pictures.{% endraw %}
