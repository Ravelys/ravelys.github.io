She also has a tendency to lie about what she's done. Her mother decides to take matters into her own hands, changing the cookie jar from a cute ceramic bear to a terrifying clown face.<br /><br />Bree will have to confront her fears in order to satisfy her sweet tooth, but when the parenting lesson goes awry, Bree has to confront something a lot bigger than just her mother.<br /><br />Director Justin Harding's comedy-horror short is a funhouse of clever thrills and chills, starting with the clever new take on the old-fashioned fear of clowns. There have been many scary clowns in film history, but this short manages to offer a fresh new entry in this tradition, thanks to excellent special effects and art direction.<br /><br />The script is briskly paced and engaging, brought to life by stellar camerawork, photography and great performances, particularly by the young lead, Ava Jamieson. She captures the emotions and character of young Bree with an ease that marks her as a screen natural, and we never  lose sight of the story's stakes as we experience the film through her eyes.<br /><br />Well-made and engaging on every level, the film is an entertaining watch and genuine creepy fun for fans of the horror genre. Capturing the way childhood terrors can become larger than life, particularly in the mind of an imaginative child, &quot;Kookie&quot; updates a primal fear in a modern way -- and is guaranteed to send shivers down the spine.<br /><br />ABOUT OMELETO<br />Omeleto is the home of the world's best short films.
