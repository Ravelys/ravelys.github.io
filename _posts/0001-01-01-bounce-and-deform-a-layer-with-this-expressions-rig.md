{% raw %}download iExpressions at<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/">https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/</a><br /><br />Today we combine two very powerful iExpressions: We use the 'Throw 2D' to bounce a layer off the ground and against some walls and the 'Elastic Shape' to deform it accordingly. Since everything is based on expressions, you can simply set a different throw direction and all the phyics and deformation update instantly. Create bouncing animations fast and effectively - and thanks to iExpressions without the need to write any expressions code yourself.{% endraw %}
