I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace to sin no more and to avoid the near occasion of sin. Amen.<br /><br />Step 4: Notice what the prayer requires<br />Notice what the prayer requires: sorrow for offending God; regret for all your sins; fear of divine retribution; love for a good God; and resolve to sin no more with the help of God’s grace.<br /><br />Step 5: Adapt essential elements for life<br />Now you know the essential elements of penance and can adapt them for life outside the confessional—your family and friends will no doubt love you even more for your penitential aptitude.<br /><br />Did You Know?<br />There are three other traditional 'Act' prayers: Act of Faith, Act of Hope, and Act of Love.{% endraw %}
