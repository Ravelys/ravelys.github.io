{% raw %}Thank you so much for being here, it means a lot to me.Been performing and hustling in Delhi for years but my Real musical journey started here in Dimapur in 2020, during the pandemic. Came from Delhi, leaving everything behind to follow my passion. Why Nagaland? cuz its a hub of great musicians and humble people, and a best place for amateur musicians like me to grow. want to thank a lot of people who have supported me through out this journey, and  I will continue to become better and better, Everyday is a Learning.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ABOUT the Song:  I wrote this song last year on November, when my producer sent me the beat, and the only thing that came into my head while listening to it was, &quot;good guys in the club&quot;. I wanted to write something different, cuz its so stereotypical shown that only guys wants or looks for hookups when they are in the parties or clubs, Even some girls do that.  so this song goes to the good guys, sensible guys who just enjoys the parties and no one night stands or hook ups. YES WE EXIST! and when I approached Moko Koza for the collab, he really loved it, Big thanks to Him and INFINITY INC. So enjoy My first debut song &quot;Some Other Time&quot; featuring Moko Koza. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Singer/Songwriter/Composer - Kevin Saka<br />Rap/Songwriter/Composer - Moko Koza<br />Producer - Hysteriix<br />Mixing/Mastering- Ina Zhimo aka DJ Ina<br />Director/Videographer - Vie Pfukha<br /><br />FOLLOW &amp; SUBSCRIBE:<br /><br />Kevin Saka<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kevinsaka__/">https://www.instagram.com/kevinsaka__/</a> <br /><br />Moko Koza<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mokokoza/">https://www.instagram.com/mokokoza/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJBKh7oV_NVJHmHEmabuVDw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJBKh7oV_NVJHmHEmabuVDw</a><br /><br />Hysteriix <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hysteriix/">https://www.instagram.com/hysteriix/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwwuxNawduEmSbhQEz9yNVQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwwuxNawduEmSbhQEz9yNVQ</a><br /><br />Ina Zhimo aka Dj ina<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/inazhimo/">https://www.instagram.com/inazhimo/</a> <br /><br />Vie pfukha <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/viepfukha/">https://www.instagram.com/viepfukha/</a><br /><br />Dance/Choreography - Dautu<br />Dance- Renna Mongzar<br />Model- Lisa Chang<br /><br />Dautu<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_dautu_/">https://www.instagram.com/_dautu_/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBEXuA28VDCm2eTvq-qY1g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBEXuA28VDCm2eTvq-qY1g</a><br /><br />Renna Mongzar<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rm_temjen11/">https://www.instagram.com/rm_temjen11/</a><br /><br />Lisa Chang<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lisa_hongang_chang/">https://www.instagram.com/lisa_hongang_chang/</a><br /><br />Location - De Ja Vu club Supermarket , Dimapur{% endraw %}
