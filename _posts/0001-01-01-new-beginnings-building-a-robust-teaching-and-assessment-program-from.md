{% raw %}So here we are, at the dusk of a holiday break. Some of us are already at work, others still enjoying sun spells on a remote island or on the private balcony on the third floor. Whether we want it or not, the time of the new school year is approaching step by step and we are here to help. Please join us in this session where we will share potential solutions of how to combine teaching and assessment into a well-designed strategy allowing your students to flourish and move forward on the educational path. <br /><br />Hosted by Bartek Janiak.{% endraw %}
