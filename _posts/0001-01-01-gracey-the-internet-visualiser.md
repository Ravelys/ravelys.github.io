{% raw %}â€˜the internetâ€™ is about a very difficult time in my life when I was experiencing a large amount of online hate as I was just starting out my artist career. Throwing myself into the process of writing and working on it was really cathartic, and addressing what was making me feel broken and vulnerable head-on ended up making me a lot stronger. Hopefully itâ€™ll resonate and do the same for others, as sadly experiencing online hate is becoming more common for all as social media continues to grow. ðŸ–¤âš¡<br /><br />GRACEY - the internet (Visualiser)<br />listen now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gracey.lnk.to/TheInternet">https://gracey.lnk.to/TheInternet</a><br /><br />FOLLOW<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://GRACEY.lnk.to/InstagramVD">https://GRACEY.lnk.to/InstagramVD</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://GRACEY.lnk.to/TwitterVD">https://GRACEY.lnk.to/TwitterVD</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://GRACEY.lnk.to/FacebookVD">https://GRACEY.lnk.to/FacebookVD</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://GRACEY.lnk.to/TikTokVD">https://GRACEY.lnk.to/TikTokVD</a><br /><br />Sign Up To GRACEY's Newsletter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://GRACEY.lnk.to/NewsletterSignUpID">https://GRACEY.lnk.to/NewsletterSignUpID</a><br /><br />GRACEY - the internet (lyrics)<br /><br />I donâ€™t think you get it<br />I was so fucked up and I never said it<br />Didnâ€™t even tell the friends I had<br />Knew that I was low didnâ€™t know how bad<br />I would get these jitters<br />Lost my sense of humour and I hated mirrors<br />Never used to see myself like that<br />Put my heart on the line then I pulled it back<br />Cause these sharks they bite<br />No such thing as a private life<br />Here you go, hereâ€™s mine<br />Here you go, hereâ€™s mine<br />Â <br />I canâ€™t keep it upÂ <br />Making out Iâ€™m good<br />Making out that Iâ€™m alright<br />When I sit and cry all night<br />I think Iâ€™m losing touchÂ <br />Nothingâ€™s quite enough<br />Making out that Iâ€™m alright<br />Wide awake when Iâ€™m still tired<br />Â <br />Fuck the internet<br />Fuck it, yeah<br />Â <br />Left to my own devices<br />I get in my head, baby Iâ€™m a Pisces<br />Feelings they build up in my chest<br />I canâ€™t tell a soul gotta hold my breath<br />Yeah, try to hide it though<br />Turn it up, turn it up,Â myÂ volume<br />Always say the loudest in the room, yeahâ€¦<br />Â <br />I canâ€™t keep it upÂ <br />Making out Iâ€™m good<br />Making out that Iâ€™m alright<br />When I sit and cry all night<br />I think Iâ€™m losing touchÂ <br />Nothingâ€™s quite enough<br />Making out that Iâ€™m alright<br />Wide awake when Iâ€™m still tired<br />Â <br />Fuck the internet<br />Fuck it, yeah<br />Â <br />I wanna talk<br />But if I talk Iâ€™m gonna cry<br />And if I cry<br />Iâ€™m gonna have to tell them why<br />And then Iâ€™ll overthink the conversation all night<br />Iâ€™m kinda tired, so Iâ€™ll be quiet though IÂ <br />Â <br />I wanna talk<br />But if I talk Iâ€™m gonna cry<br />And if I cry<br />Iâ€™m gonna have to tell â€˜em why<br />And then Iâ€™ll overthink the conversation all night<br />Iâ€™m kinda tired, so Iâ€™ll be quiet though IÂ <br />Â <br />I wanna talk<br />But if I talk Iâ€™m gonna cry<br />And if I cry<br />Iâ€™m gonna have to tell â€˜em why<br />And then Iâ€™ll overthink the conversation all night, all night<br />Â <br />I canâ€™t keep it upÂ <br />Making out Iâ€™m good<br />Making out that Iâ€™m alright<br />When I sit and cry all night<br />I think Iâ€™m losing touchÂ <br />Nothingâ€™s quite enough<br />Making out that Iâ€™m alright<br />Wide awake when Iâ€™m still tired<br />Â <br />Fuck the internet<br />Fuck it, yeah<br />Fuck the internet<br />Fuck it<br /><br />#GRACEY<br /><br />Music video by GRACEY performing the internet (Visualiser).
