{% raw %}A theoretical &quot;genocide route&quot; battle theme for Noelle from Deltarune, i tried using different songs from the OST that have to do with Noelle and incorporate them into this song<br />The intro and first main melody is mostly taken from Lost Girl, the triplet bridge part is from a currently nameless song that isn't on the OST (Noelle's Realization), the main chorus part is a minor key version of the second part of Girl Next Door<br />I tried to aim for a mix of &quot;Deltarune style&quot; and my own style, but of course i am not Toby Fox, so it cannot sound exactly like him, nevertheless, i tried my best to make it feel close to something that could actually be in the game<br /><br />ASK FOR PERMISSION FIRST BEFORE YOU USE THIS FOR ANYTHING<br /><br />If you have read this far, thank you, i wish you a nice day!{% endraw %}
