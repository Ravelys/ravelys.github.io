{% raw %}Squid Game impresses in so many ways - and their sets throughout the show are no different! Shockingly, very little CGI was used in cases it would be pretty typical in - outdoor scenes, larger than life objects… but the team behind the Netflix hit went all out and built loads of the sets from the ground up.<br />The scale and variety is impressive, but what makes us love the work even more is the little hidden messages throughout the show. There are murals on a wall, stacked metal beds alluding to themes in the show - truly every aspect was considered. <br />The realistic sets were a bit help in getting the actors into character and one cast member in particular had a major nostalgia moment when he walked onto the sets of the marbles game. These impactful sets could actually transport performers! Some actors felt like they were in a fantasy land, from the colourful and nonsensical staircases to giant children’s playgrounds to tug-of-war platforms. The staircase itself is actually inspired by a famous piece of art!<br />While the dorms may have been somewhat dull looking, the size of the set was enormous and some actors felt like they were performing in a colosseum! The prison-like aesthetic is a strong contrast to all the environments we see during the games. The sets weren’t the only huge parts of the show - Red Light, Green Light featured a huge and terrifying prop that managed to steal the show. <br />So many worlds were created in just one small space, a filming studio about an hour outside of Seoul, South Korea - a studio where the magic of Squid Game came to life!<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Things</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:18 Tug-of-War<br />01:11 The Dorms<br />01:49 Hidden Messages<br />02:39 Artistic Stairs<br />03:22 Giant Playground <br />04:08 Giant Doll<br />04:54 Marbles Nostalgia<br />05:34 Little CGI<br />06:21 Reality vs Expectations<br />07:12 Home Base<br />07:42 Outro<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />Written by: Thalia GK<br />Narrated by: Serena L<br />Edited by: Joaquin Carlvaho<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
