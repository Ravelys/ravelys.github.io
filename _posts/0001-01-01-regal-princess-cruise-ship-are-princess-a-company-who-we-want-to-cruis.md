{% raw %}In episode 5 (our last episode in this series) we experience more of what Princess Cruises have to offer. We discuss whether we think Princess has been a hit or a miss for us and whether we would cruise with Princess Cruises again.<br /><br />We cruised on the Regal Princess Cruise Ship on one of the first UK Seacations in August 2021 out of Southampton. This was our first cruise with Princess and we spent four days on board cruising the coast of the UK.<br /><br />For more episodes of this series and other Princess Cruises content here - <br />Princess Cruises Playlist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_6zC3nwhe70s81Y1YwoZrHPofObNq3Mb">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_6zC3nwhe70s81Y1YwoZrHPofObNq3Mb</a><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Relevant Links - <br /><br />Cruising out of Southampton - Check out our recommended Pre Cruise Hotels Post here on our website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paulandcarolelovetotravel.com/southampton-hotels/">https://paulandcarolelovetotravel.com/southampton-hotels/</a><br /><br />Cruising Videos and Vlogs Playlist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_6zC3nwhe70IK9QWQ-14QezjHmB_3BpT">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_6zC3nwhe70IK9QWQ-14QezjHmB_3BpT</a><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />About Paul and Carole Love to Travel<br />We are a married middle aged couple from Gloucester, England who share our tips, advice and experience on how you can choose the right cruise line, cruise ship snd cabin.
