{% raw %}Because of his troubling resemblance to man, the Monkey has left its mark on our imaginations, and has been associated with many beliefs and representations for thousands of years.<br /><br />In the Hindu religion, the monkey is a revered figure. In Bali, Indonesia, the ‚Äúmonkey dance‚Äù recounts the epic victory of Hanuman, the monkey god, who delivered Queen Sita from the claws of the evil Ravana, the god of demons. <br />In Jodhpur, in India, langur monkeys are considered to be the descendants of Hanuman‚Äôs soldiers, and a blessing for the people.<br />In the Buddhist religion, the monkey‚Äôs image is more complex. As a slave to his desires, he symbolizes man left to his own animalistic impulses.<br /><br />Extract from the documentary: ‚ÄúTribal Animals - Apes‚Äù<br />Direction: J√©r√¥me S√©gur &amp; Jean Queyrat<br />Production: ZED &amp; France T√©l√©visions<br /><br /><br />SLICE wants to fill up your curiosity!<br />Accessible to anyone from anywhere at any time, this channel is your weekly dose of short docs about curious facts, discoveries, astounding info, unusual stories, weird, fun and instructive.
