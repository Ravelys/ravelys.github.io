Zych Farms has been harvesting in awful conditions fighting extreme mud. The John Deere Combine and Case Quadtrac are buried! #TractorRecovery<br />How and why is the water so clean? Not only does soil capture water, but soil also filters water. Water that moves into and through soil is cleaned by physical, chemical, and biological processes. When pollutants carried by water get caught in the small pores of the soil, they get physically cleaned. After draining, the soil has more pore volume available for water infiltration during the next rain because of the larger volume of empty pores.<br /> Consequently, more infiltration and less runoff may occur with an artificially drained soil compared to a poorly drained soil, depending on the next rain’s nature and timing. A very intense rain may not produce much infiltration in either case.<br />If you're looking for meat processing in MN or The Dakotas check out Zychs Butchery<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zychsmeats.com/">https://www.zychsmeats.com/</a><br /><br />Special Thank You to Our Signature Sponsor<br />Farmers Business Network<br />FBN membership is now FREE!

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike.  A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture.<br />With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture.  Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. <br /><br />Follow Along<br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/">https://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/</a><br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/">https://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/</a><br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/farmmillennial">https://twitter.com/farmmillennial</a><br /><br />Edited By:<br />Becky Johnson{% endraw %}
