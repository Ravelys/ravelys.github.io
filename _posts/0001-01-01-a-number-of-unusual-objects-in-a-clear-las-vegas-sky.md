{% raw %}Photographs in this slideshow presentation are from the 26th of October, 2021. They were taken with a Galaxy S21 Ultra smartphone camera from my backyard here in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas, Nevada. I never saw any of the objects in these photos until I started looking at them closely. Knowing I had to black objects in these photos, I decided to look at them more thoroughly today. To my surprise, I found several other images with unusual things in them, and I could tell that they weren't airplanes because the photos are so clear and show planes even further away from where I was shooting, and these objects were. It's a bit of a surprise to me how I can be looking at the sky and not see them, but there they are in my photos. I've come to believe that this happens more often than someone might imagine.<br /><br />#UFOsOverVegas, #LasVegasUFOs, #UFOsOverArea51{% endraw %}
