{% raw %}Big double stack intermodal train goes through what looks like a building!  This is the Norfolk Southern mainline going under 4 lane highway 23.  CSX tank train on big curved trestle.  These are trains near Portsmouth , Ohio.  The contain train on NS is at Rosemount just a few miles north of Portsmouth.  The CSX tank car train is between Waverly and Piketon which is also just north of Portsmouth, Ohio.  Isn't that cool how the NS train goes under the road in a huge area that never gets wet?  I bet the railroad ties last longer under that roof.  It feels like being in a parking garage.  This is an old Norfolk &amp; Western Railway line.  Both lines go through Columbus, Ohio and then through Portsmouth, Ohio and they parallel each other in a few spots.  I filmed this on October 13, 2021.  I was there for 6 hours and saw 2 NS trains and 1 CSX train.  That was a slow day for these routes but I did notice that both lines had track maintenance going on.  The NS line uses 161.190 as the main frequency and CSX uses 160.230 for their main frequency.  Use 452.9375 for EOT.<br />Thanks for watching!<br /> Please thumbs up and watch another JawTooth video to help my channel.
