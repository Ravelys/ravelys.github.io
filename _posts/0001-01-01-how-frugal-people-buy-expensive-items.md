{% raw %}A viewer recently wrote with a question about buying top-quality items when one is also frugal. We created this video to answer her question and also share how frugal people buy expensive items. <br /><br />Frugality is not deprivation. It's about choosing when, where, and how we will spend our money. Often, that involves, buying long-lasting products, which tend to cost more than average. <br /><br />Becoming comfortable with letting go of money is important in a balanced approach to finances. When we create goals, do our research, look for a great price, then paying cash for what we want can fit in with both frugality and good stewardship. <br /><br />00:00 - Introduction<br />01:30 - Viewer Question <br />06:31 - Make Saving for Large Purchases A Goal<br />06:54 - Pay Cash for Large Purchases<br />08:53 - Do Research before Making Large Purchases<br />11:34 - Research Alternative Products<br />12:30 - Consider Buying Used <br />14:10 - Find a Coupon for Large Purchases <br />14:50 - We Answer the Viewer's Question<br />16:00 - Decide It's Okay to Spend the Money<br /><br />//TIP JAR: Want to send us a special &quot;Thank You&quot; for our content?
