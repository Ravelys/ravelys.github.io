{% raw %}As we get ready for the next season of Grey’s Anatomy and our return to Grey Sloan hospital, it’s time for another Grey’s video! So today we will be looking at the Grey’s Anatomy cast, and specifically at Derek Shepherd, AKA McDreamy (played by Patrick Dempsey). <br /><br />In fact, we’re going behind the scenes of Grey’s Anatomy to bring you the truth behind McDreamys exit, because we’ve discovered a secret! Although Greys Anatomy is now very much Ellen Pompeo’s gig, as Meredith Grey, Derek was a fan favorite. This is why it pains us to admit that his departure wasn’t everything it seemed, because offscreen, this actor was a nightmare! <br /><br />So join us as we answer an important question: was McDreamy actually a nightmare on the set of Greys? This and many other answers are coming your way in this OSSAm video, so keep on watching for all the Grey’s tea!<br /><br />💛 OSSA on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ossa_tv">https://bit.ly/ossa_tv</a><br />💜 OSSA on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ossa_tv">https://www.tiktok.com/@ossa_tv</a><br />💙 OSSA on facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OSSA-937878333055503/">https://www.facebook.com/OSSA-937878333055503/</a><br /><br />⭐OSSA is the best source for entertainment news about the celebrities we love.<br />⭐Our YouTube channel dishes up celebrity news and gossip on the stars you admire the most.
