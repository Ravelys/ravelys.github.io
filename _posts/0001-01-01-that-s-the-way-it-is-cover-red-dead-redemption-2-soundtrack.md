It has a very special place in everybody's heart I think. But it really has a particular place in mine. This song was the first one I released on my channel when I discovered Red Dead Redemption 2. It's the song that gave me the boost and visibility that I had been working so hard for the previous 5 years. Since there were some more verses added in the OST release, I though I should probably do a version like that too. I hope you like this new version as much as I do!<br /><br />Please consider subscribing if you like what I do. You can also get early access to upcoming videos by becoming a Patron!
