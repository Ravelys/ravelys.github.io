It wasn’t long before they became fully-fledged members of the iconic Blitz Club scene and established themselves as one of the super-groups of the 80s. <br /><br />The band's classic line-up features brothers Gary and Martin Kemp on guitars, vocalist Tony Hadley, saxophonist Steve Norman and drummer John Keeble.<br /><br />After two decades apart, the band reformed in 2009, embarking on a sold-out tour. In 2014 the band released a critically lauded documentary film ‘Soul Boys Of The Western World’ and returned to the studio recording three new tracks 'Steal', 'Soul Boy' and 'This Is The Love' for the anthology 'The Story'. ‘<br /><br />This has been followed by the ‘Soulboys Of The Western World’ world tour wowing crowds and critics alike with the band making rapturous returns for the first time in 25 years to USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and parts of mainland Europe.<br /><br />Spandau Ballet’s hits include Gold, True, To Cut A Long Story Short, Through The Barricades and many more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.spandauballet.com/">http://www.spandauballet.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/spandauballet">https://www.facebook.com/spandauballet</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/spandauballet">https://twitter.com/spandauballet</a>{% endraw %}
