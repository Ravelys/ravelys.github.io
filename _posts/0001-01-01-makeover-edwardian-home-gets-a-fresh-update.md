{% raw %}Designer Emilia Wisniewski and her husband, landscaper Pete Kiriakopoulos, both of Studio 1Nine1, transform a dated Edwardian home in Toronto’s High Park into a fun destination for a growing family. This house is full of smart budget updates and durable finishes. There’s a magical wallpapered reading nook for the kids, while adults can entertain at the blush-tiled basement bar. A new deck with cooking and dining zones and artificial grass turns a small backyard into the ultimate play zone in the city.<br /><br />Design, Studio 1Nine1, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.studio1nine1.com/">http://www.studio1nine1.com/</a><br /><br />Sources:<br />All Walls CC-30 Oxford White Benjamin Moore<br />FOYER <br />Wallpaper, Newwall.
