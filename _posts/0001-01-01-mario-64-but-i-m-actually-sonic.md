{% raw %}Today I played Super Mario 64, although with a little twist - I've become Sonic.<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Check out Theis Thodds! : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ThoddsGame">https://twitter.com/ThoddsGame</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee &amp; oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />Simply speedruns SM64 as Sonic. Not a sentence I thought I would be typing, but here I am. Simply played as creators such as Alinity, Emiru, and STPeach were running around the house in Austin, TX. Simply mario speedrun rom hack was almost as cool as Mizkif OTK's Loot Golbins. When am I invited? Clint Stevens is always invited to do SM64 challenge runs with me. Or we can do some SM64 races and get the Mario 64 World Record in the 120 star catagory. Big secret: I'm going to be getting the world record soon and then post a new Simply 120 Star World Record video. That would be epic. Anyways, should I try speedrunning SM64 as sonic for real and what my person best would be? Let me know :smile:{% endraw %}
