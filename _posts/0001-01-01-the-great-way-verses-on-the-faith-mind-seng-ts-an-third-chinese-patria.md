{% raw %}Hsin-hsin Ming, commonly known as &quot;Verses on the Faith-Mind&quot; by Seng-ts'an, Third Zen Patriarch. This is a class short Zen scripture. It really expresses a profound viewpoint on reality. It is short - but many people contemplate it for many years, finding deep inspiration for their daily practices and way of life. <br /><br />The text can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mendosa.com/way.html">http://www.mendosa.com/way.html</a><br />Translated By Richard B.
