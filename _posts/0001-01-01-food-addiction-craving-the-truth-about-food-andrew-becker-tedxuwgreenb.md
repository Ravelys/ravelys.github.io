{% raw %}Andrew Becker discusses how the current food environment of today motivates us to consume until we are obese. We are evolutionarily primed to thrive in a food scarce environment with natural foods, but now face an endless supply of processed junk food that has the power to cause addiction.<br /><br />Recorded and edited courtesy of NorthCoast Productions. Andrew Becker is from the small town of Slinger Wisconsin, and completed his bachelorâ€™s degree in human biology with an emphasis in dietetics from the University of Wisconsin Green Bay. Currently, he is completing his Ph.D. in biochemistry in Dr. Jong-In Park's lab at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The focus of his research is to investigate how certain types of cancers utilize the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to promote their proliferation. Along with his research, Andrew has an immense passion for nutrition. He believes it is important for everyone to understand how the foods they eat affect their health. He has made it a life-long goal to continuously teach the public about nutritional health whenever he gets the opportunity. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
