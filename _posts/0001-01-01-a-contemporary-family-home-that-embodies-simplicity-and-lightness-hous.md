{% raw %}Brighton East residence by InForm is a contemporary family home that embodies simplicity and lightness, designed in collaboration with project architects Pleysier Perkins. With the homeowners and clients having lived at the previous house on the premises for over 10 years, InForm was commissioned to design a family home that placed an emphasis on natural materials and exposed brick, yet was modern in appearance, design and architectural features.<br /> <br />As you enter the house, an internal courtyard to the right of the entry hallway ensures that light fills the communal downstairs spaces, with the living room and lounge (blue room) treated to views of lily-pads and the sound of flowing water. Towards the rear of the property, the back garden and pool area provide entertaining areas and space for the whole family – a natural extension of the rear of the family home and a thoroughly modern solution to entertaining.<br /> <br />With InForm handling the build and construction components of the home, and engaging with their long-time collaborators Pleysier Perkins on the architecture and interior design, it is evident that the house was only made possible thanks to the relationship shared between client, architect and builder. A study in simplicity and lightness, this house tour showcases the fine contemporary family home and landscaped gardens that have been made possible thanks to InForm’s commitment to building excellence and passion for the project.<br /><br />Enjoy the project feature house tour of Brighton East by InForm, a contemporary family home that embodies simplicity and lightness. <br /><br />Design and Construction by InForm.<br />Architecture by Pleysier Perkins.  <br />Video by Cheer Squad Film Co. <br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />For More from The Local Project: <br /><br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a><br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br />Pinterest – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/thelocalproject/">https://www.pinterest.com.au/thelocalproject/</a><br /><br />#architecture #interiordesign #familyhome{% endraw %}
