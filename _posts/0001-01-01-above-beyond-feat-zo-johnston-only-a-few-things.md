{% raw %}Only a few things will we recall<br />With love, with gratitude<br />Only a few things<br />On the hour in which I die<br /><br />So if I cannot tell you if though words I do not find I want you to know<br />There are only a few things that I will be carrying<br />In my memory when I go<br /><br />Only a few things will we recall<br />With true happiness with gratitude<br />Only a few things<br />I see you, I see you<br /><br />You, you were the joy in my life<br />The one who loved my tired bones<br />You are the one who came to stay<br /><br />So if I do not tell you if I don't find the words<br />It is not because I don't feel it in my heart<br /><br />You're the one who loved my tired bones<br />You're the one who took me home<br />You're the one who loved my tired bones<br />You're the one who took me home<br /><br />You, you brought joy to my world<br /><br />So I will tell you now<br />In case you don't know<br />You will be with me when I go<br /><br />Only a few things will we recall<br />With love, with gratitude<br />Only a few things<br />On the hour in which I die<br /><br />I do not own this song!!!{% endraw %}
