How do you serve the question?<br />See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world<br />I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world<br />I don't love people enough to put my faith in man<br />I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band<br />I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around<br />This time I might put you down<br />Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now<br />My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb<br />I’m willing to give up a leg and arm than show empathy from<br />Pity parties and functions of you and yours<br />A perfect world, you probably live another 24<br />I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure<br />I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure<br /><br />[Chorus: Steve Lacy &amp; Kendrick Lamar]<br />Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />In another life, I surely was there<br />Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />I care, I care<br /><br />[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar &amp; Anna Wise]<br />Maybe I wasn’t there<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br /><br />[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]<br />Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive<br />Cold as December but never remember what Winter did<br />I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid<br />Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays<br />Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there<br />Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here<br />I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back<br />The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that<br />Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride<br />A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies<br />Promises are broken and more resentment come alive<br />Race barriers make inferior you and I<br />See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches<br />I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison<br />I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service<br />Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world<br /><br />[Chorus: Steve Lacy &amp; Kendrick Lamar]<br />Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />In another life, I surely was there<br />Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care<br />I care, I care<br /><br />[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar &amp; Anna Wise]<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br />Maybe I wasn't there<br /><br />#kendricklamar #kdot #damn{% endraw %}
