The bass lines seem to be a bit more prominent in the mix and the overall sound is a little less muddy. Freddie singing &quot;that's okay!&quot; has been removed right before Bowie sings, &quot;it's the terror of knowing...&quot; It is unknown who did this remix. It is rumored that this is actually an old mix from around the Hot Space time period&quot;.<br />Info taken from www.QueenVault.com<br /><br />This video is a new mix between the Wembley version (12/7/86), the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert version at the same stadium in 1992, and the now old video made by DoRo for Under Pressure (Rah Mix) in 1999.<br /><br />@elvillegas Rocks!<br />#Kast<br />#ChileDiceNOalComunismo<br />#LonconQLIA<br />#AbajoLaConstituyente<br />#ConstituyentesBasura<br />#CircoConstituyenteChile<br />#KastRules<br />#CommiesMustDie<br />#TwitterSucks<br />#LosImpuestosSonRobo<br />#FuckBiden<br />#FuckUN<br />#FuckUNESCO<br />#ProgresDeMierda{% endraw %}
