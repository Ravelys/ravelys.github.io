{% raw %}It's like An Amicable Area, except it's simply opulent instead.<br /><br /><br />The other, calmer version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xjn6JKhDLMM">https://youtu.be/xjn6JKhDLMM</a><br /><br />So I tried that thing that some musicians do, where they have like one song but release two different versions of it, because y'know why the heck not. I've got the time.<br /><br />Yeah, I know the name barely makes sense, but if Waterflame and Kevin MacLeod have taught me anything it's that song names don't have to make sense.<br /><br />Music and art (except background ofc) both by me - hence the mediocre quality.<br /><br />I promise that someday, I'll get the hang of it.{% endraw %}
