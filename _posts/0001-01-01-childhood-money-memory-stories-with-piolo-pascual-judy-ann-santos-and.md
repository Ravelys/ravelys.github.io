{% raw %}You may not realize it, but how you experienced money as a child has a great impact on your current relationship with money. And this is why in our FQ Workshops, this exercise is always a big aha! moment for our participants. This is your CHILDHOOD MONEY MEMORY (CMM).<br /><br />What did you hear your parents say about money? Did you hear them quarrel about it? Did they always buy what you wanted or did you have to save up for them? Did you feel like you had more, or less money, than your relatives and friends?<br /><br />Whatever your money story was while you were growing up, it had a very big impact on the way you relate with money right now. In order to develop a healthy relationship with money, FOUNDATION is key, so letâ€™s go back to where it all started. <br /><br />In this video, I want to share with you the childhood money memories of three of the most popular and established actors in Philippine showbiz - Matteo Guidicelli, Piolo Pascual and Judy Ann Santos - to hopefully inspire you and also make you think about your very own childhood money memory. May this continue to help you in your #FQMondayHabit towards financial happiness! <br /><br />This will be the first in a series of childhood money memories from some of the most influential people from different careers and industries.
