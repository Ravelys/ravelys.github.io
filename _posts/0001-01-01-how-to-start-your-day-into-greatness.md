{% raw %}Entrance into greatness depends on the way you begin each day. <br />Psalms 118v24 says; This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it. <br />Everyday is God’s day which implies you’re entitled to treasure which only your faith in God can deliver. <br />True worship is God-centered worship. People tend to get caught up in where they should worship, what music they should sing in worship, and how their worship looks to other people. Focusing on these things misses the point. Jesus tells us that true worshipers will worship God in spirit and in truth (John 4v24) . This means we worship from the heart and the way God has designed. Worship can include praying, reading God’s Word with an open heart, singing, participating in communion, and serving others. It is not limited to one act, but is done properly when the heart and attitude of the person are in the right place.<br />#how<br />#greatness <br />#worship <br />#prayer{% endraw %}
