{% raw %}The song Chances from the new Strokes album, Comedown Machine.<br />Lyrics<br />I waited for ya<br />I waited for ya<br />I waited on ya<br />But now I don't<br /><br />You didn't see it<br />I didn't see it<br />I didn't see it<br />But now, oh, I do<br /><br />I play your game<br />I play your game<br />Now<br />I play your game<br />I play your game<br /><br />I take my chances alone<br />Get on your horse and be gone<br />I will not wait up for you anymore<br />So you can ask me if something is wrong<br />Little girl<br />I don't know anymore<br /><br />When the night isn't ready for you<br />It's a feeling I know that dogs you<br />They invited a stewardess, too<br />Now they want you to see it<br />Here's to days he decides he's got time<br />And he claims that it's not a surprise<br />When he finds out the truth's on his side<br /><br />I take my chances alone<br />Get on your horse and be gone<br />I will not wait up for you anymore<br />So you can ask me if something is wrong<br />Little girl<br />I don't know anymore<br />I don't believe anyone<br />As they crawl out of my way<br /><br />Waiting for the night<br />Leaving night by night<br />You can see me travel<br />We could be in trouble every night<br />We're havin' a new life{% endraw %}
