The artist began her singing career as a participant on the acclaimed Jazz and 90s where her take on the No Doubt hit Don't Speak set the bar for jazz versions.  She soon realized that her true calling lay in the swinging beats of the Brazilian musical genre. Her first album released in 2014 found her applying bossa touches to a number of contemporary pop classics and the results were astounding. While she mainly works alone, Sarah can be found in the studio recording with James Farrelli , with whom she has worked on versions of Africa and Eye in the Sky.<br /><br />#SarahMenescal #Bossanova #Covers{% endraw %}
