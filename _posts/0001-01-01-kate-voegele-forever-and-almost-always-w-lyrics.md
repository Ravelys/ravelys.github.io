{% raw %}So the story goes on down<br /><br />The less traveled road<br /><br />It's a variation on<br /><br />The one I was told<br /><br />And although it's not the same<br /><br />It's awful close, yeah.<br /><br /><br /><br />In an ordinary fairy tale land<br /><br />There's a promise of a perfect happy end<br /><br />And I imagine having just short of that<br /><br />Is better than nothing.<br /><br /><br /><br />So you'll be mine<br /><br />Forever And Almost Always<br /><br />And I'll be fine<br /><br />Just love me when you can, yeah<br /><br />And I'll wait patiently<br /><br />I'll wake up everyday<br /><br />Just hoping that you still care.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the corner of my mind I know too well<br /><br />Oh that surely even I deserve the best<br /><br />But instead of leaving<br /><br />I just put the issue to bed<br /><br />And outta my head.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh and just when I believe<br /><br />You've changed for good<br /><br />Well you go and prove me wrong<br /><br />Just like I knew you would<br /><br />When I run out of second chances<br /><br />You give me that look<br /><br />And you're off the hook.<br /><br /><br /><br />Because you're mine<br /><br />Forever And Almost Always<br /><br />When I'm fine<br /><br />Just love me when you can, yeah<br /><br />And i'll wait patiently<br /><br />I'll wake up everyday<br /><br />Just hoping that you still care.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh, oh, what am I still doing here?<br /><br />Oh, oh, oh, it's all becoming so clear, yeah.<br /><br /><br /><br />You'll be mine<br /><br />Forever And Almost Always<br /><br />It ain't right <br /><br />to just love me when you can, oh<br /><br />I wont wait patiently<br /><br />Or wake up everyday<br /><br />Just hoping that you'll still care.<br /><br /><br /><br />Forever And Almost Always<br /><br />No it ain't right<br /><br />To just love me when you can, baby<br /><br />Ain't gonna wait patiently<br /><br />I won't wake up everyday<br /><br />Just hoping that you still care, oh.{% endraw %}
