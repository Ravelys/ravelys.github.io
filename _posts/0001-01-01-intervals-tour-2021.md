{% raw %}VIP &amp; GA TICKETS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.intervalsmusic.net/">http://www.intervalsmusic.net/</a><br /><br />It's happening. It's finally happening. This is the headline tour we intended to roll out when Circadian dropped at the end of last year! I know there are some cities missing, and trust me, we did our best to hit everything we could, but this is the absolute best we could do given the timeframe and the circumstances. We'll be back to playing anywhere &amp; everywhere on planet earth, as soon as it's possible again. Tickets are going fast, so if we're playing your city, don't hesitate to snag tickets at the link below, and we'll see you guys very soon!<br /><br />OFFICIAL GUITAR TABS &amp; JAM TRACK BUNDLE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jdWcZq">https://bit.ly/3jdWcZq</a><br />PURCHASE &amp; STREAM : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/intervals">https://linktr.ee/intervals</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/aaronintervals">https://www.instagram.com/aaronintervals</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/intervalsmusic">https://www.facebook.com/intervalsmusic</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/intervalsmusic">https://twitter.com/intervalsmusic</a><br />Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com">https://intervalsmusic.bandcamp.com</a><br /><br />Filmed and Edited by Mike DeMellia{% endraw %}
