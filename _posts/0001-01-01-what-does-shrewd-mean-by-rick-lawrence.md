{% raw %}It's the one Bible story Christians won't hear in church.<br /><br />It doesn't make sense: Jesus tells his disciples to take a lesson from Satan himself. In fact, he implies, if you are going to be any good for the Kingdom of God, you've got to be as shrewd as Satan-yet as innocent as the Holy Spirit. A scandalous idea? Yes. Essential to the Christian life? Definitely.{% endraw %}
