{% raw %}An experiment with an old Transporta lift. I was trying to LEVITATE inside of it. This allows me to ride it with open doors. This lift can run with open inner doors when empty. The doors don't have to be closed when a weightless ghost rides this lift :). The (relay?) logic doesn't seem to be surprised that buttons are being pressed inside an empty lift :). This is what I call a non-ghost-proof lift. Don't try to do what you see in the video - this may be dangerous.{% endraw %}
