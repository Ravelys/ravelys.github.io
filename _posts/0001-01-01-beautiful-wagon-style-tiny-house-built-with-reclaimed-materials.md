{% raw %}This tiny house was originally built to be a canvas-covered bow top wagon but was recently renovated to add insulation in the round walls as well as a metal roof.  The woodwork in this home is absolutely stunning, with a custom standing desk, a curved kitchen counter, a sofa that converts to a bed, handmade windows, and an ornate dutch door.  It was built by Nick who also created the folding tiny house that we featured a couple of years ago here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/A2i8URcy6Ww">https://youtu.be/A2i8URcy6Ww</a><br /><br />You can follow Nick's beautiful and unique tiny house builds on Instagram here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/k.knack/">https://www.instagram.com/k.knack/</a><br /><br />Caravans like this can be quite dark inside since it's difficult to have windows in a canvas cover.  This is another reason why Nick modified the original home to have solid walls so that he could add dormers for extra light.  The house has simple systems: it is heated with an antique wood stove, it's powered with a 110-volt panel, and water comes from a hose that can be hooked up to the kitchen sink on the outside.<br /><br />This video was filmed by Alex Harris and you can see more of her incredible photography and videography work here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alexharrris.com/">https://alexharrris.com/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Mat &amp; Danielle<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />STAY IN TOUCH!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Website: www.exploringalternatives.ca<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog">https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblog</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/">https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />COMMENTS<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and contribute.
