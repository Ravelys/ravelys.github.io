{% raw %}Today we are taking a tour of the Penthouse Collection at 67 Franklin Street, at the Cast Iron House. Originally built in 1881 by James White, 67 Franklin Street represents one of New York’s most stunning examples of 19th-century cast iron architecture. The landmark building’s neoclassical façade rises six stories, with intricate ornamentation that shifts subtly from one floor to the next. In reimagining the 13-unit building, architect Shigeru Ban respected its historic detailing, but reenvisioned its interior volumes and created two glass and steel penthouses that represent the height of contemporary living. <br /><br />Listed By: Ryan Serhant, Jennifer Alese, and Krista Nichols<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.serhant.com/listings/3691356">https://www.serhant.com/listings/3691356</a> <br /><br />Property Info:<br /><br />Landmark atop a Landmark.
