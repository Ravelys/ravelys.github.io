{% raw %}💡 Rock the coolest Bright Side MERCH (open globally!) at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2OJubyA">http://bit.ly/2OJubyA</a><br /><br />A lot of the times your brain “feels” way younger or older than you are. That's called mental age. Do you wanna know yours? Lucky for you, Bright Side put together a simple test that will help you figure out if you're a carefree child, an old and wise sage or just exactly as mentally “old” as you are. Just answer our questions, write down your points for every answer, add them all up and get your results! But enough talking, let's begin! <br /><br />If you got 7-12 points, mentally you're just under 20 years old. It doesn't matter what your passport says – you’re a carefree teenager at heart! If you're way older than 20, congratulations – you've managed to carry this constant feeling of enthusiasm and love for life through all these years. Keep shining!<br /><br />If your result is 13–20 points, you are 20–29 years old. You are active, creative, and full of life, but you can already call yourself an adult. Childhood and teenage years are over, but you took the best from them and left all the unnecessary stuff behind. It doesn't mean that you're not having fun though – your life is just as exciting as it was.<br /><br />If all of your points added up to 21–28 points, your mental age is 30–39 years. You’re still active and curious about new things and ideas, but you are already responsible and thoughtful. If you think about it, that's the perfect balance between the children's joy for life and adults' independence. The golden mean at its best! <br /><br />If your total number of points is 29–35, you are 40–49 years old. You're mature and experienced, and you know exactly how to live your life. You have no time for nonsense – you're determined and hardworking. You know what you want and how to get it. Continue to be a true inspiration for everyone around!<br /><br />36–40 points mean that your mental age is over 50 years. And that's not a bad thing at all! On the contrary, you are wise and calm. You get what life is all about, and you highly appreciate comfort. You're the person everyone goes for advice, plus you can always be trusted. These are some rare qualities today, so your friends must protect you at all costs.<br /><br />So what’s your mental age and how close is it to your real age?<br /><br />#colortest #guessage #mentalage<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />SMART Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/JTfP6L">https://goo.gl/JTfP6L</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Have you ever seen a talking slime?
