Beginning with a midline sternal incision, the heart is connected to a perfusion machine which will take over the duties of the heart while the surgery takes place. Two different grafts are used to bypass the blocked coronary arteries: the internal thoracic artery from inside the chest wall, and the saphenous vein from the leg. After the procedure, the heart is shocked to restart its beating. A drainage tube is left at the incision site to drain away excess fluid.  The animation continues to show two other types of approaches to a coronary artery bypass graft, off-pump bypass surgery and minimally invasive bypass surgery.<br /><br />This is similar to the procedure performed on former president Bill Clinton and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br />#HeartBypassSurgery #CABG #heart<br />ANCE00199{% endraw %}
