{% raw %}Death by the Great Outdoors<br /><br />Mother Nature isn't always nurturing and she was out to get an overly ambitious kite flyer. But a snake shouldn't kill after it's pickled in beer. And golf isn't a particularly lethal sport.<br /><br />This is a scientific investigation of case studies where death has come from unexpected means. The viewer will invest themselves into the story and the science without simply waiting for the next gruesome grizzly scene. And for these reasons Curious and Unusual Deaths will never feature any deaths involving children pets or suicides. Curious and Unusual Deaths is a romp through the world's weirdest fatalities - and the scientific story behind each one. It's the science that kills when death shows no mercy.<br /><br />YOU CAN ALSO WATCH:  Dimmu Borgir, Cannibal Corpse, Mayhem, Six Feet Under,<br />Cradle Of Filth,  Death, Gregorian, Gorgoroth, Dark Funeral, Immortal, Nile,<br />Solemn They Await, Aborted, Autopsy, Ancient, Belphegor, Deicide, Ahab, Frowning,<br />The Jonestown Mass Suicide Tape, Vader, Sinister, Obituary, Necrophagist, Morbid Angel, Monstrosity,  Macabre, Immolation, Hanging Garden, Gorguts, Darkthrone, Cancer, <br />Depressive Suicidal Black Metal, Curious and Unusual Deaths,<br />Fred Dinenage Murder Casebook, Serial Killer Biography, As it happened,<br />Car Crash Compilation, <br /><br />Please Like Share And Subscribe My Channel{% endraw %}
