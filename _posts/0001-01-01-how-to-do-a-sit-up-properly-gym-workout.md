Now, a lot of you guys are out there doing situps in the gym but few of you guys are doing it correctly.  So, I'm going to show you how to do it.  All Right.  Take a look.  <br /><br />Now, very important, a sit up means that we're coming from the floor into sitting up.  All right.  Now your feet must stay on the floor.  The thing that people do mostly wrong in the gym is they tug on their neck and try to get themselves up.  And do this:  one, and back, and back.  And that's wrong.  All right.  <br /><br />I'm going to show you the way to do it.  Nice and controlled.  Nice and slow.  One, slow on the way down.  Two, three, four.  All right.  So that is the way to do a proper situp.  Now guys, go out there, have a ball, knock some abs out and do your situps correctly.  All right?  Be safe.{% endraw %}
