{% raw %}We often hear that ‘the government makes all the decisions’ or that the ‘government will build schools and hospitals’. But do we know what ‘government’ really means and what it actually is responsible for?<br /><br />Governance is the form or system of rule by which a state or nation is organised and governed. This happens through a system made up of laws and institutions. <br />Government normally consists of the legislature, which creates the laws; the executive, which implements the laws; and the courts, or judiciary, which interpret and apply the laws.{% endraw %}
