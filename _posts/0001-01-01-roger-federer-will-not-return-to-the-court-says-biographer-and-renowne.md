{% raw %}Roger Federer made a brief comeback to the ATP Tour in 2021. He played in three rounds of the French Open and reached the Quarterfinals of Wimbledon, before taking another long break due to injury, a break which is still ongoing. <br /><br />He’s had to undergo another knee surgery which, while successful, has raised some question marks about his ability to continue at an elite level. The most recent poser of the inevitable question is renowned journalist and a sports columnist for The New York Times, Christopher Clarey.<br /><br /> Author of ‘The Master: The Brilliant Career of Roger Federer’, Clarey has recently voiced his doubts about Federer’s potential return to the court. Clarey recently gave his perspective on Roger Federer‘s retirement. In an interview when asked, “When will Federer retire?”  The Journalist replied, “I don’t believe he will return to the circuit (after another knee surgery). It’s a guess.<br /><br />I believe he will realize, during his rehabilitation process, that time has changed. The new guys arrived. He has a lot to do in his life. At 40, what else will you conquer on the circuit?” Fans of the Swiss Maestro have been desperately awaiting to see if a returning Federer can match his previous levels. <br /><br />Clarey poured cold water on those dreams as he continued,” He may even come back, but it will be a slow and difficult comeback. I don’t think he can win more Grand Slam tournaments. And I think you won’t be happy if you don’t have a chance of winning these tournaments.” In August 2021, Christopher Clarey published the Federer’s biography, ‘The Master: The Brilliant Career of Roger Federer’.<br /><br />Federer’s injury update!<br /><br />The legendary Swiss player recently made a remarkable appearance at Laver Cup 2021. Federer received a warm welcome from the crowd in Boston. At Laver Cup, the Maestro revealed some positive news regarding his knee injury.<br /><br />Roger Federer confessed that he’s in a good place right now, but the Swiss will take a few more months to recover fully. He said, “I took the time and, I don’t know, I’m just really in a good place. I’m really happy.”<br /><br />Clearly, the 20-time Grand Slam champion is pretty optimistic about his return to the ATP tour. Federer is currently tied with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic for the most number of Grand Slam titles, at 20. What do you think, who will acquire the 21st Grand Slam title first?{% endraw %}
