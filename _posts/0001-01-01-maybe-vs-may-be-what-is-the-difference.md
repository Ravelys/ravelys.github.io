{% raw %}What is the difference between MAYBE  and MAY BE?<br /><br />This is a common mistake in written English, even for native speakers.<br /><br />First we look at the meaning of MAYBE (one word).<br />Then we look at the meaning of MAY BE (two words).<br /><br />We give an example using both of these words in the same sentence and explain what each one means.<br /><br />The we have some more example sentences to highlight the difference between these words.<br /><br />Finally we have a simple quiz that contains 8 sentences. Viewers need to correctly add the word MAYBE or MAY BE in the blank space. Answers are given after a brief pause.<br /><br />For more details and example sentences, see our grammar lesson here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.woodwardenglish.com/maybe-may-be-difference/">https://www.woodwardenglish.com/maybe-may-be-difference/</a><br /><br />#Maybe #EnglishGrammar #CommonMistakes<br /><br />++++++++++++<br /><br />NOTE: Our English lessons and English language resources are for people over the age of 13.<br /><br />Do you like WOODWARD ENGLISH and want to learn more and improve your English?
