{% raw %}&quot;S-so...th-that which our world is to be gifted with is...&quot; (This is not serious people!)<br /><br />Utata-P, Wogura, and Toriihitsuji don't let up when it comes to finding creative new takes for their Happiness Series. I am sure some people will want to complain about how it is seemingly to criticize religion and God, but even though it references the Bible, I think that this song is more generally making a parody out of how in almost all religions from ancient ones to the Judeo-Christian era, literal interpretations or tales of God's (or Gods') actions according to myth or holy books are actually quite violent and resulted in the death of many people, and how perhaps to some people who don't share that religion or faith, looking on it from the outside, it can have an almost &quot;well who is actually the bad guy here?&quot;-kind of feeling about it. Also how good is wogura at drawing the cute faces with just a touch of insanity? She gets it so right here again once more!<br /><br />Once again, these amazing subs would never be possible without my friend Vervain (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/vervainsubs)">https://www.youtube.com/user/vervainsubs)</a> chipping into take make it a reality. I mean...he even made the subs appear behind Miku sometimes! Is he a wizard?!?<br /><br />This song is also going to be part of Download album released this year which features a super-strong producer line-up.
