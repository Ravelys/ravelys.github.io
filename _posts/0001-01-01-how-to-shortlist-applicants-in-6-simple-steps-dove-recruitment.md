Choose the right person to do the short listing. This should be someone with the right experience in HR and recruitment processing. <br /><br />2. Identify essential and desirable criteria. Focusing on these key points should be how you conduct your first round of elimination. <br /><br />3.How many applicants would you like to interview? It's very easy to get confused when only a few applicants are left, unfortunately this is where you have to be ruthless. <br /><br />4. Take your time. Wait until the closing timeline before you begin shotlisting, jumping in too soon and waste your time interviewing the first few applicants that can apply. <br /><br />5. Don't be afraid to pick up the phone! Don't be afraid to call an applicant while you're short listing and requesting further information from them. <br /><br />6.Respect your applicants. Applicants should never be assessed based on their age, race or sex. You can create a general response to all that are unsuccessful but everyone has the right to a reply.{% endraw %}
