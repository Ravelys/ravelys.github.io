{% raw %}Paramount House Hotel by Breathe is a super hotel designed as a sanctuary in the heart of the city. Located in the vibrant Sydney neighbourhood of Surry Hills, the hotel was born out of a love for hospitality. Instilled with a strong sense of community, with the intention of crafting a holistic and realistic experience for guests, Paramount House Hotel embodies design as an integral facet of placemaking.<br /><br />The initial brief for the hotel was very rough, aiming for a tone and an ambiance rather than an aesthetic. With an understanding of place, the hotel offers a more curated experience than a traditional hotel – it is proposed as a super hotel designed as a sanctuary in the heart of the city. The nature of the building’s structure meant that each room had to be different. However, they are tied together with a uniform visual aesthetic, refined by the inclusion of local designers – this allows the overarching experience for guests to always be the same regardless of what room they stay in, with each room featuring elements such as indoor and outdoor plants, terrazzo, timber bathtubs and linen textiles.<br /><br />As a super hotel designed as a sanctuary in the heart of the city, Paramount House Hotel leans into its raw and original bones. Reflecting on its history, the ground floor was once a loading dock for Paramount Pictures. Similarly, the original cinema still stands as a working movie theatre – an ode to the original purpose of the building where they would show films that had been created inhouse. <br /><br />The rooftop is host to a small boutique gym, with classes available for guests. As a super hotel designed as a sanctuary in the heart of the city, it was important that Paramount House Hotel under promises and over delivers, providing elements of surprise and curiosity for guests.<br /><br />Creating a sense of individuality, Paramount House Hotel is a super hotel designed as a sanctuary in the heart of the city. Its copper façade, with its changing patina, has become the unofficial spokesperson for the project, inviting guests to experience all it has to offer.<br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Architecture by Breathe.<br />Photography by Sharyn Cairns and Tom Ross.<br />Build by Calida and Promena Projects.<br />Filmed and Edited by Cheer Squad Film Co. <br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />Musicbed SyncID: MB01BARO9RDF4XC<br /><br />#SuperHotel #Sanctuary #InTheHeartOfTheCity #Sydney #SurryHills #Hotel #Hospitality #Guests #Travel #Aesthetic #ParamountHouseHotel #SenseOfPlace #Architecture #InteriorDesign{% endraw %}
