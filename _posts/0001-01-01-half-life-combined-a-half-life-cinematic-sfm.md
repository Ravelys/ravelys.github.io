{% raw %}The Combine Empire is ever expanding thanks to their significant ability to adapt and survive in new and hostile environments. By enslaving and combining themselves with the natural inhabitants of conquered worlds, they are able to swiftly take over and claim control of new dimensions. <br /><br />Some natural inhabitants will more willingly than others choose to combine themselves with the Combine Empire, in exchange for a better standard of living. Perhaps to protect and care for a loved one, however, things may not always turn out the way one had intended.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For this cinematic I did my best to 'show not tell' the story. The dialogue is at a minimum, and the story is shown through character expressions and movements. If you have anything you think could improve the future story telling of my cinematics, please leave it in a comment! :)<br /><br />The story is of course not canon, and my work is in no way associated with the work of Valve, however, I tried to stick as much to the Half-Life lore with this one as I could, but there's still a few things I have added here and there. <br /><br />If you enjoyed the film, I would gladly appreciate if you left a comment or a like on the video, it would help me a lot for future projects! :)<br />Thanks for watching, more Half-Life animations and sketches coming up before you know it! Stay tuned!{% endraw %}
