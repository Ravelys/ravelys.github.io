{% raw %}This is the first of 3 videos I’m making about mechanical devices (mechanisms). It is suitable for GCSE students studying Design Technology and also GCSE Engineering. In this video I explore what is meant by the term “mechanical device” and explain the 4 types of motion (linear, rotary, reciprocating and oscillating) by giving clear explanations and lots of examples. <br /><br />I then move on to “levers”. I explain the difference between 1st, 2nd and 3rd order levers (or class 1, 2 and 3) and give everyday examples of each of the 3 types, also showing students how to draw them. <br /><br />In this video I originally intended to cover mechanical advantage and velocity ratio calculations but I have now decided to cover this in one of the other 2 videos I will be making about mechanisms and mechanical devices. In these 2 other videos I will also cover cams and followers, linkages, bell crank, crank slider and various types of gear (including gear ratio and speed calculations).{% endraw %}
