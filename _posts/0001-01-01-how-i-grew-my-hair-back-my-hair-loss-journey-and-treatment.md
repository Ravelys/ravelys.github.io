{% raw %}Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.keeps.com/locust">http://www.keeps.com/locust</a> for a VERY SPECIAL offer on Keeps hair loss treatments. Thanks to Keeps for sponsoring!<br /><br />Please LIKE, COMMENT and SUBSCRIBE, It helps more than you know!<br /><br /><br /><br />Today's video: a VERY different topic from what we're used to, but i've had A LOT of people asking for this (mainly in my weightloss video in the comments and via email and DM). Today I share with you my hair loss journey and how i was able to grow it back! Now, this wasnt a small feat, and it required dedication and regularly using the KEEPS treatment. I am so grateful to have started it and am able to share my experience with you! I hope this encourages anyone out here who felt like there was no hope and have hair thinning, hair receding or any level hair loss. This is how I grew my hair back!  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MAIL STUFF MY WAY:<br /><br /><br /><br />Paul Fuenteballa<br /><br />23986 Aliso Creek Rd.<br /><br />Laguna Niguel, CA, 92677<br /><br />Box #504<br /><br /><br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kzchillmode">https://soundcloud.com/kzchillmode</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic">https://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Social Media:<br /><br />Instagram- PaulFuentebella<br /><br />SnapChat- PaulFuentebella<br /><br />Twitter: FuentebellaPaul<br /><br />Facebook community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1780802502239764/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1780802502239764/</a>{% endraw %}
