{% raw %}In the modern political world, the terms â€˜left-wingâ€™ and â€˜right-wingâ€™ can often be heard and misunderstood. But what do these terms mean and where do they come from? The terms Left and Right were first used in an ideological context during the French Revolution of the 18th century. Those on the left were in support of the revolution and those on the right supported the monarchy. This idea of the left supporting change and the right wanting to keep the status quo continues today and is key in some of their philosophy. <br /><br />Time Stamps ðŸ“½<br />Introduction 0:10 <br />The Difference in Ideology 0:38 <br />Left-Wing Ideology 0:46<br />Left-Wing Economics 1:10<br />Right-Wing Ideology 1:39<br />Right-Wing Economics 2:03<br />Political Parties 2:28<br />Left and Right in Context 2:45<br />Libertarian and Authoritarian 3:25<br />Difficult to Place on a Scale 3:40<br />Choose Wisley 4:03<br /> <br />Other Videos: <br /><br />Nikola Tesla Explained In 16 Minutes | Nikola Tesla Documentary<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8JDXSYw1U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8JDXSYw1U</a><br /><br />Sun Tzu - The Art of War Explained In 5 Minutes <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz4FNBj1APA&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz4FNBj1APA&amp;t</a><br /><br />The Fall of Rome Explained In 13 Minutes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJz15Y6hKMM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJz15Y6hKMM</a><br /><br />Norse Mythology Explained In 15 Minutes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxzmJPoRu8&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxzmJPoRu8&amp;t</a> <br /><br />Genghis Khan and The Mongol Empire Explained In 8 Minutes: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDyece8CQF8&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDyece8CQF8&amp;t</a><br /><br />Greek Gods Explained In 12 Minutes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-AoKE42rw&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-AoKE42rw&amp;t</a><br /><br />Fall of The Soviet Union Explained In 5 Minutes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M16RMXZDG_g&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M16RMXZDG_g&amp;t</a><br /><br />World War 2 Explained | Best WW2 Documentary | Part 1:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHPLWDyHio">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHPLWDyHio</a><br /><br />The Vietnam War Explained In 25 Minutes | Vietnam War Documentary:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tNTh6KlXXU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tNTh6KlXXU</a> <br /><br />Egyptian Gods Explained In 13 Minutes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bURNgGA2lzM&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bURNgGA2lzM&amp;t</a><br />Music by:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ryantothec">https://soundcloud.com/ryantothec</a><br /><br />Stock footage by:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod">https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod</a><br /><br />The Life Guide is a channel dedicated to providing interesting and educational content about a range of political, philosophical, economic and historical topics.
