{% raw %}Well. I did not expect this to happen. Only 2 months ago I was fully vaccinated and yet I still tested positive for covid. Having said that, breakthrough cases do have much different symptoms on a whole, than catching covid while unvaccinated. The situation here in Ukraine is pretty bad at the moment with the delta variant said to be responsible for the quickly growing cases. Thankfully I am feeling much better now, but definitely was not something I was expecting!<br /><br />Support my journey on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/alinamcleod">https://www.patreon.com/alinamcleod</a><br />Paypal Account: alina_397@hotmail.com<br /><br />Travel Medical Insurance I use:<br />Get 5% OFF Hey Mondo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://heymondo.com/?utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_source=ALINAMCLEOD&amp;cod_descuento=ALINAMCLEOD&amp;ag_campaign=ENTRY&amp;agencia=fb170151c29dc50b20851c24ceec6ffbfa13">https://heymondo.com/?utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_source=ALINAMCLEOD&amp;cod_descuento=ALINAMCLEOD&amp;ag_campaign=ENTRY&amp;agencia=fb170151c29dc50b20851c24ceec6ffbfa13</a><br /><br />SafetyWing (best for younger travelers + digital nomads): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://safetywing.com?referenceID=alinamcleod&amp;utm_source=alinamcleod&amp;utm_medium=Ambassador">https://safetywing.com?referenceID=alinamcleod&amp;utm_source=alinamcleod&amp;utm_medium=Ambassador</a><br /><br />*I use both of these companies depending on the destination and requirements of entry. If you are going to be abroad for a long time and/or don't need as much coverage, I would recommend SafetyWing. BUT you cannot purchase SafetyWing WHILE in Canada or USA. You can only purchase once already abroad. Hey Mondo is more expensive but offers a higher level of coverage including plans that have trip cancellation/interruption insurance. Hey Mondo would be the better insurance to use if you need travel medical insurance when applying for a visa. Both companies cover covid. I am an affiliate for both companies, but I pay for my own policies.*<br /><br />My Favorite Travel Backpacks + Luggage - Osprey: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&amp;ti=846581&amp;pw=303785">https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ml&amp;ti=846581&amp;pw=303785</a><br /><br />1 FREE AUDIOBOOK FROM AUDIBLE (I loooooove this service): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audibletrial.com/alinamcleod">https://www.audibletrial.com/alinamcleod</a><br /><br />The Music I Use In My Videos - Epidemic Sound<br />Get a 30 Day FREE TRIAL by using my referral link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/j6z374/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/j6z374/</a><br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />- Equipment I Use To Film Videos -<br /><br />Main Video Camera: DJI Osmo Pocket - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/AHIq4h77lb1vLK27c8be2A?pm=link">https://click.dji.com/AHIq4h77lb1vLK27c8be2A?pm=link</a><br />*The Version 2 is out now as well, which I will probably upgrade to at some point: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/ANA1EaqbXqELrc1wb6JfuA?pm=link">https://click.dji.com/ANA1EaqbXqELrc1wb6JfuA?pm=link</a><br /><br />Action Camera: DJI Action - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/AP_Tm8c2qz3LDWCF82L_FQ?pm=link">https://click.dji.com/AP_Tm8c2qz3LDWCF82L_FQ?pm=link</a><br /><br />Photography + Sit down camera: Sony a6400 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cSYaMK">https://amzn.to/3cSYaMK</a><br /><br />Drone: DJI Spark *they don't make it anymore, but the comparable option is the DJI Mini 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/AGoXunTdo53IK4uNU2HZ_g?pm=link">https://click.dji.com/AGoXunTdo53IK4uNU2HZ_g?pm=link</a><br /><br />Microphone: Rode Micro - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3muSHz8">https://amzn.to/3muSHz8</a><br /><br />Livestreaming Equipment: Iphone 11 and DJI OM 4 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/AAGFnJdwHRotLSYz1ITfUw?pm=link">https://click.dji.com/AAGFnJdwHRotLSYz1ITfUw?pm=link</a><br /><br />*** FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA ***<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alinamcleod">https://www.instagram.com/alinamcleod</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/alinamcleodofficial/?view_public_for=189580024403094">https://www.facebook.com/alinamcleodofficial/?view_public_for=189580024403094</a><br /><br />WEBSITE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.alinamcleod.com/">http://www.alinamcleod.com/</a><br /><br />Мой русскоязычный канал / My Russian Speaking Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUO4pFMywMoe3TBMcbJq2IA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUO4pFMywMoe3TBMcbJq2IA</a><br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />*** I USE AFFILIATE LINKS ***<br />Affiliate links do not cost you as the consumer any more than you would normally pay, but it does offer a kickback to the person who initiated the sale.
