{% raw %}Graves' Disease (Hyperthyroidism) Explained - Made Easy<br />Graves Disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by hyperthyroidism due to circulating autoantibodies. It is also the leading cause of hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces excessive hormones. It affects up to 2% of the female population, sometimes appears after childbirth, and occurs seven to eight times more often in women than in men. Once the disorder has been correctly diagnosed, it is quite easy to treat. In some cases, Graves’ disease goes into remission or disappears completely after several months or years. Left untreated, however, it can lead to serious complications and even death.<br /><br />More Info on Graves' Disease: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dailymeded.com/graves-disease-signs-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/">https://www.dailymeded.com/graves-disease-signs-symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/</a><br /><br />This video tutorial is brought to you by: Dr. Ali Feili MD, MBA<br /><br />✔ FREE Medical Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freemedicalvideos.com/">https://freemedicalvideos.com/</a><br />✔ Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.DailyMedEd.com/">https://www.DailyMedEd.com/</a><br />✔ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/DailyMedEd/">http://www.facebook.com/DailyMedEd/</a><br />✔ Twitter: @DailyMedEd<br />✔ Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/DailyMedEd/">https://www.pinterest.com/DailyMedEd/</a><br />✔ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/DailyMedEd/">https://www.instagram.com/DailyMedEd/</a><br /><br /><br />This information is intended for educational purposes only, and should not be interpreted as medical advice.
