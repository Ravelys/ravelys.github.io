{% raw %}Thank you guys for jamming our new EP, &quot;And I Return To Nothingness&quot;. <br />After seeing how well my one take playthrough of 'To the Hellfire' did, I decided to do another one:<br />***This is a one take performance, there are no layers,  no doubles, no edits.***<br />What you see here is exactly what you'd get live<br />I hope you enjoy!<br />.<br />If you'd like me to do more playthroughs off the  &quot;A.I.R.T.N&quot; EP, let me know in the comments.<br />Like/comment/share subscribe if you like what you hear.<br />.<br />Vocals mixed/mastered by Cody Stewart{% endraw %}
