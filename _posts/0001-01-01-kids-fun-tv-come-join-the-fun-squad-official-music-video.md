Whether it’s games or fun action skits, the kids and their parents love to have fun and play. We have lots of boys vs girls competition videos as well as twin vs twin games. We love box forts, toys and playing fun and exciting games. Whether it’s playing jokes on their dad with a toy, having an amazing birthday party, singing cover songs, creating movie remakes or having a fun superhero adventure, these funny kids love to have fun and play. Sneaky as a spy and skilled as a ninja, the Fun Squad members team up and work together to solve a mystery in each skit adventure. The children (Jack Skye, Jazzy Skye, Kade Skye, Kalia Skye and Kyler Skye) love to have lots of family fun (with Mom and Dad also) in their skits and games. <br />The Kids Fun TV channel loves making fun videos for kids and fun videos for ages 13 and older. <br />This footage is the property of Kids Fun TV and is not allowed to be repurposed without written consent from Kids Fun TV. <br />Business &amp; Other Inquiries, please email:  Admin@TheFunSquad.com <br />Fans can send emails here:  Fanmail@TheFunSquad.com{% endraw %}
