{% raw %}- Lyrics<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder<br />if everything changed<br />How would we make out<br />And now suddenly thunder <br />and everything's changed<br />there's this big dark cloud<br />Hovering...<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Hovering, hovering, hovering<br />[You always said that we'd make it through]<br />troubling, stumbleling, fumbleling<br />for the words that saying that I'm leaving you<br />I'm leaving you<br /><br />We go through the motions<br />Like everything's settled but<br />it's inside out<br />And it makes us uncomfortable<br />still holding on when there's all this doubt<br />Hovering...<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Hovering, hovering, hovering<br />[You always said that we'd make it through]<br />Troubling, stumbling, fumbling<br />for the words that saying <br />that I'm leaving you<br />I'm leaving you<br /><br />And maybe we're just older<br />(Older)<br />Just a little older<br />(Older)<br />'Cause the fact that this is over<br />The fact that this is over<br />with you<br /><br />Hovering, hovering, hovering<br />[You always said that we'd make it through]<br />Troubling, stumbling, phonering<br />for the world to say that I'm leaving you...oh<br />I'm leaving you...<br /><br />Traveling, stumbleling, fumbling<br />For the words that say <br />that I'm leaving you<br /><br />(whispers)<br />You always said that we'd make it through...<br />You always said that we'd make it through...{% endraw %}
