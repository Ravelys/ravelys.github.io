{% raw %}Medicine as performed live by Harry Styles in Amsterdam, March 14, 2018<br /><br />I know people still argue about if it's &quot;him&quot; or &quot;them&quot;, but I went with &quot;with them&quot; because it's the more logical progression from the previous line.<br /><br />I think I became a fan overnight and I'm still reeling<br /><br />Edit: Also, go check out the videos of this song performed at the St. Paul stop! I don't know what was in the water there but the boy was feelin' it.<br /><br />==========================<br /><br />** To the people arguing over whether he's gay or bi or pan or straight... The most Harry's ever said concretely about what label he choose? Is that he doesn't label himself. He's &quot;never felt the need to&quot;. <br /><br />We are not entitled to any more than that. No matter what his lyrics say, what beliefs you may hold, or what you think you read from his actions, sexuality isn't something you can determine for another person. The least we can do is be respectful of the fact that he doesn't want a label right now, and not try to affix one to him without his say-so.<br /><br />Calling this song a bi anthem or harry a gay/bi/lesbian icon is one thing. Saying with conviction that he IS gay is another. I think we as a fandom need to work on having more respect for the man we profess to be a fan of.{% endraw %}
