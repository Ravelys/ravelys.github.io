{% raw %}What's the trickiest word in English? For Vicki and Jay it's the adverb quite.<br /><br />Sometimes quite means the same thing in British and American English, but sometimes it's used differently. <br /><br />Is the meaning of quite, very or completely? It looks like a small difference but it can lead to big misunderstandings. <br /><br />In this video we show you <br />- how to use quite to mean completely<br />- how to use not quite (meaning not completely) to criticize someone gently or say you disagree.<br />- how quite can mean very in American English, but fairly or pretty in British English<br />- how you can often tell what the meaning of quite is depending on whether it's used with gradable or ungradable adjectives.<br /><br />Finally we have some advice for any American guys who are going on a date with a British girl.<br />Don’t tell her she’s quite pretty!<br /><br />Make sure you subscribe to this YouTube channel. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=vickihollettvideo">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=vickihollettvideo</a><br /><br />Facebook Page:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SimpleEnglishVideos/">https://www.facebook.com/SimpleEnglishVideos/</a> <br />Twitter:  @vickivideos <br /><br />To get notified by email when we publish a new video, sign up to our mailing list: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.aweber.com/form/46/1978668946.htm">https://forms.aweber.com/form/46/1978668946.htm</a><br /><br />Visit our website to see our videos with transcripts and much more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.SimpleEnglishVideos.com">http://www.SimpleEnglishVideos.com</a><br />There you can get email updates on new videos and live classes and also download a free copy of 'Fix It', a checklist for correcting common English mistakes <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.simpleenglishvideos.com/free-fix-it-checklist/">http://www.simpleenglishvideos.com/free-fix-it-checklist/</a>{% endraw %}
