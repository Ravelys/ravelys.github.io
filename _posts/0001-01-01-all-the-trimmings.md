{% raw %}Paul is a desperate father who knows he can't provide presents for his kids again this Christmas. But maybe he can at least provide Christmas dinner... and is willing go to extreme lengths to make this happen.<br /><br />All the Trimmings is a true story inspired by the director Tommy Edwards own upbringing, growing up with very little and having to find value in the small things.<br /><br />In the current climate we live, where the disparity within the distribution of wealth is growing ever bigger and the expectation of consumerism is changing what we value,  Tommy feels that this story has become ever more relevant, providing a vital voice to the stories of those living on the breadline and hopefully helping re-enforce the values of family and community.{% endraw %}
