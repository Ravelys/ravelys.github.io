{% raw %}Brothers Joseph, Lazarus and Abel, our three novices, share their monastic day and their thoughts on monastic life here at the Abbey of Gethsemani. Br. Joseph and Br. Abel have since made their simple profession and have moved from the novitiate to the juniorate. There are a few shots from the ceremony, during which they receive the black scapular and leather belt, at the end of this little movie.<br /><br />For information about our abbey and vocations, check out our website:<br /><br />www.monks.org{% endraw %}
