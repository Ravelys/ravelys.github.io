{% raw %}The power of change begins with one, which is why God effects change with the power of one. As believers, we are the ones who are in hellâ€™s view, as the enemy seeks to distract us from accomplishing Godâ€™s goals. The ones are world-changers whose most significant power is the power of choice. We are no greater than the choices we make; therefore, we must be vigilant, as there will be a fight to perform the change God has called us to implement. Take courage, for fighting in the spirit is essential, for our strength is developed through resistance. God is going to give us a moment, and we must walk in power to grasp the moment.<br /><br />Subscribe to the official T.D.
