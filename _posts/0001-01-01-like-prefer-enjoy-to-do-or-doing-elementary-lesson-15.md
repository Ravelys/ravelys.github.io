The diffrrence is whether you put the emphasis on the result of your action and preference (&quot;I like to make this salad&quot; - you like the salad, and don't put the emphasis on the process of cooking; or &quot;I prefer to drink coffee&quot; - your preference is coffee, but not tea, for instance) or you want to emphasize that you enjoy the process (&quot;I like cooking&quot; - you enjoy this process).<br />The verb enjoy can be followed only by verbs in their -ing form: &quot;She enjoys travelling.&quot;<br />_<br />#LIKE#PREFER#ENJOY#englishlesson#learnenglishonline#English#learnenglish#studyenglish#englishonline#englishvocabulary#Ëã±Ë™ûË™≤Á®ã#Ëã±Ë™ûÂú®Á∑ö#Â≠∏ÁøíËã±Ë™û<br /><br />English courses for adults and young adult learners &quot;Los Angeles English School&quot;. <br /><br />Learning English in Los Angeles English language school is realized by means of a specially designed program developed according to international standards of teaching English as the second language. <br /><br />With this program beginners in English start to speak confidently just in a couple of months of having classes.
