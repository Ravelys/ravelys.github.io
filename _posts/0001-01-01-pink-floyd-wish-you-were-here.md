{% raw %}Pink Floyd, Wish You Were Here (1975)<br /><br /><br /><br />So, so you think you can tell<br /><br />Heaven from Hell,<br /><br />Blue skys from pain.<br /><br />Can you tell a green field<br /><br />From a cold steel rail?<br /><br />A smile from a veil?<br /><br />Do you think you can tell?<br /><br /><br /><br />And did they get you to trade<br /><br />Your heros for ghosts?<br /><br />Hot ashes for trees?<br /><br />Hot air for a cool breeze?<br /><br />Cold comfort for change?<br /><br />And did you exchange<br /><br />A walk on part in the war<br /><br />For a lead role in a cage?<br /><br /><br /><br />How I wish, how I wish you were here.<br /><br />We're just two lost souls<br /><br />Swimming in a fish bowl,<br /><br />Year after year,<br /><br />Running over the same old ground.<br /><br />What have we found?<br /><br />The same old fears.<br /><br />Wish you were here.{% endraw %}
