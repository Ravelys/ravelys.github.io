{% raw %}From the concept album by progressive metal band Coheed and Cambria, &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ten years before Silent Earth, the children of a lost war now fight to regain what their parents had killed themselves over.  With his sons around him, Jesse Kilgannon and his Iro-bots continue the lost rebellion started by his lover Mariah.  Manning the massive Jackhammer turrets, the small group attempts to fend off against an invasion by the forces of Tri-Mage Wilhelm Ryan, Jesse's hatred and fury fueling his vicious returning volleys.<br /><br /><br /><br />And off in the universe, as Jesse fought as a speck on the Fence, his brother's blood machine was lost for ten years...{% endraw %}
