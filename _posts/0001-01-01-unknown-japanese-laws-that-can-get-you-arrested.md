Over the years I’ve come across some Japanese laws that aren’t completely obvious, especially to visitors so I thought I’d make this fun video and share it with all of you.  In fact, these Japanese laws are stuff that many Japanese consider manners or common sense, but they’ve taken it one step further and made it official law just in case someone decides to go against the grain. Whether or not the Japanese authorities decide to arrest someone or prosecute though maybe a different story, but nonetheless these laws may be one of the reasons why things in Japan stay in order.  Many of the items shared in the video fall under Japanese 軽犯罪法, Keihan zaihou or the minor crime law which is sometimes explained as &quot;a law that stipulates the minimum level of morality that citizens should observe in their daily lives and it targets &quot;bad acts&quot; that are often seen in daily life.  All minor crime law violators could face a fine between about $10 to $100 and or jail time of 1 to 30 days. <br /><br />Get my Tokyo &amp; Japan Merch and show your support! <br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch">https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch</a><br /><br />--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----<br />See My Life in Japan behind the scenes<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra">https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra</a><br /><br />Questions about Japan or Japan Travel?
