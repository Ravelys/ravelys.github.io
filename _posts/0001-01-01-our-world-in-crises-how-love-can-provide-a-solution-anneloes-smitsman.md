{% raw %}Anneloes Smitsman believes that love is a strong solution to the problems of our world in crises. She encourages us to ask three questions about being a vector of love: 1) What do I reach from? What is my point of origin? 2) How far can I reach inside and outside myself? 3) What am I reaching for?<br /><br />Anneloes Smitsman is the Founder and CEO of EARTHwise Centre. Anneloes has over 20 years of experience in transformational change and wisdom based innovation for individuals and organisations. She is also a writer, researcher, coach, trainer, and a mother. Her unique insight, vision, and approach for unlocking the development potentials of people and organisations, brings forth the deepest changes required for leadership and sustainability founded on love. Anneloes was instrumental in the development and implementation of the Education for Sustainability programme for the Catholic Schools network in Mauritius, active since 2011. In 2012 Anneloes developed the main methodology for the 2012 Rio+20 Global Dialogues, which was adopted in 9 different countries. She also played a key role with local stakeholders in the le Morne Mountain UNESCO World Heritage process.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
