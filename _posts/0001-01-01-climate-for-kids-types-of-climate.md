{% raw %}Educational video for children to learn what climate is and the different types of climate there are in the world. The factors that affect the climate are latitude, altitude, landscape, nearby seas or sea currents. Because of these factors, the elements that make up the climate (temperature, precipitation, humidity, pressure or winds) vary from one place to another. There is a big variety of climates on Earth that we normally divide into hot, temperate and cold climates. In this video, the little ones will learn about the characteristics of the equatorial climate, the tropical climate, the desert climate, the mediterranean climate, the oceanic climate, the continental climate, the polar climate and the high-mountain climate. Over the past centuries, the climate on Earth has been changing as a consequence of global warming, meaning the increase in global temperature owing mainly to human activity. Remember that it's in your hands too, to look after the planet and prevent global warming. <br /><br />Thanks for visiting us!
