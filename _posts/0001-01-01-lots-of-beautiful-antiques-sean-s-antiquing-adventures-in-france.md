{% raw %}Today's bootsale had lots of very interesting items, so join me for this virtual antiquing tour in France and see what I could find in this lovely old town!<br /><br /><br />&quot;Vide grenier&quot;: Literally means &quot;attic empty&quot;, we'd say bootsale for the UK - it's a type of street sale where locals stall out with personal items they'd like to sell. I sometimes call them “vide gren’s” for short.<br /><br />&quot;Brocante&quot;: A thrift store, second-hand shop, usually contain many antiques but can have all sorts of items. Many bargains to be found in these! <br /><br />If you are new to the channel, welcome, my name is Sean as you may have already guessed, and I moved to France with my family many years ago. On my channel I share with you my daily life as an expat in the rural french countryside, my hobbies and passions such as antique collecting (especially copper), bargain hunting, DIY, restoring old treasures, traveling, cooking, gardening, unboxing... and much more!
