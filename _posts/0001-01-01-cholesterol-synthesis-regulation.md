{% raw %}This video is about rate determining step in cholesterol synthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis rate limiting step or cholesterol synthesis regulated step is catalyzed by an enzyme HMG CoA reductase. HMG COA reductase converts HMG COA to mevalonate by using NADPH. HMG COA reductase is regulated allosterically, covalent modification, regulated the gene level by SREBP and SCAP, and by insulin and glucagon. <br />In this video I have explained in detail how cholesterol synthesis or cholesterol biosynthesis is going on in the cytoplasm of our cells. Cholesterol is synthesized by the condensation of acetyl CoA molecules eventually forming 27 carbon cholesterol molecule. While explaining cholesterol synthesis I have also explained different uses of farnesylpyrophosphate into dolichol, ubiquinol (CoQ10), and prenylation process.<br /><br />Video link for cholesterol biosynthesis <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zjP6WYed-AU">https://youtu.be/zjP6WYed-AU</a><br /><br />I will uploading videos one to two times per week, for regular updates SUBSCRIBE to this channel by clicking the red button below my videos or in the link below: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/eMs6rw">https://goo.gl/eMs6rw</a><br /><br />If you find these videos helpful, spread the news and SHARE with your friends. <br /><br />For short write up of theory on USMLE Biochemistry and other topics on food and nutrition, obesity, weight loss tips you may visit my site: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.drmungli.com/">http://www.drmungli.com/</a><br /><br />You can follow my Facebook page Biochemistry Made Easy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/23S9Y7">https://goo.gl/23S9Y7</a><br /><br />checkout other awesome channels to learn biochemistry and other subjects from: <br />ThePenguineProf: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ySNURB">https://goo.gl/ySNURB</a><br />Osmosis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/d1zBs1">https://goo.gl/d1zBs1</a><br />Armando: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/jcYwwR">https://goo.gl/jcYwwR</a><br />Khan Academy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/7YmIf9">https://goo.gl/7YmIf9</a><br />Nucleus Medical Media: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xdlqsr">https://goo.gl/xdlqsr</a><br />Trending medical youtube channels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nUuJOL">https://goo.gl/nUuJOL</a><br />20 useful sites for medical students: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/aPnc19">https://goo.gl/aPnc19</a><br />Biochemistry single line questions site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PFCewk">https://goo.gl/PFCewk</a><br /><br />Pictures and video graphics used in my videos came from <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pixabay.com">https://pixabay.com</a> <br />which are CC0 creative commons, free for use commercially and no attribution needed. <br />Some of the pictures are downloaded from <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pexels.com">http://pexels.com</a><br />Free to use commercially with no attribution needed.<br />Some of the pictures are downloaded from Wikimedia commons <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> <br />Appropriate attribution is given to these figures wherever applicable.<br /><br />Sounds used in my videos mostly came from copyright free sound from <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com/">https://www.bensound.com/</a>{% endraw %}
