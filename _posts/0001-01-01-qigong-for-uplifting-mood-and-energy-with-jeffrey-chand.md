{% raw %}If you are feeling down, blue, or heavy, perhaps this Qigong routine can help! This is a simple Qigong (Chi Kung, Qi Gong, Ki Gong) routine that is centred around the exercise &quot;Wild Goose Flying.&quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.qigongforvitality.com/qigong-for-uplifting/">http://www.qigongforvitality.com/qigong-for-uplifting/</a><br /><br />This is a short, simple, and easy routine that is great for beginners, seniors, and those who have aches, pains, and injuries but it certainly can be helpful if you are just feeling as if you need to be &quot;uplifted.&quot;<br /><br />If you experience depression, you suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or you just feel down from time to time it's important to have a variety of tools to help you help yourself.<br /><br />There are times when we need professional help, medication, or supplementation but if we can help boost our energy, immune system, qi, and optimize our brain chemistry on our own - that's fantastic! <br /><br />Qigong is a wonderful tool to use to help yourself :)<br /><br />As you probably already know - Qigong is a gentle exercise, similar to Tai Chi but easier to practice and more focused on building the health, healing the body, and slowing down the aging process. <br /><br />It is like a moving meditation.   <br /><br />There are many different forms of Qigong, the most important aspect is finding a style that suits you.<br /><br />In this video, we discuss the exercise &quot;Wild Goose Flying.&quot; It's a very common Qigong practice that is found in routines such as the ShiBashi (that is in the Communi Qi) and there are many variations of it. <br /><br />Just practice along and try to increase your range of motion gently over time.  Breathe, visualize, relax, and allow your qi to move smoothly!<br /><br />This series is excellent for lifting the energy, brightening the mood, and it might even put a smile on your face :)<br /><br /><br />**If you want to make sure you receive all of our new YouTube videos, please join our newsletter- don't worry we won't spam you and you can always unsubscribe :)<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ZRtB7N">https://goo.gl/ZRtB7N</a><br /><br />To get the full benefit of qi gong practice I would highly recommend practicing full routines which can be found in the &quot;Communi Qi.&quot; This is an online library with:<br /><br />-full qigong routines<br />-short qi gong routines<br />-members question and answers<br />-the &quot;Universi Qi&quot; where we discuss Qigong, Traditional Chinese medicine, wellness, and inspiration<br />-over 100 videos!<br />-members only discussion forum where you can connect with like-minded people<br />-live show coming soon!!<br /><br />Come join us for a free 7 day trial!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://qigongforvitality.vhx.tv">https://qigongforvitality.vhx.tv</a><br /><br />Become a member of our Communi-Qi and feel your best!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://qigongforvitality.com">http://qigongforvitality.com</a><br /><br />Like us on Facebook at <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/QiGongForVitality/">https://www.facebook.com/QiGongForVitality/</a>{% endraw %}
