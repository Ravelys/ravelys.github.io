{% raw %}A lot of us were raised with Jesus JUST about to come back, or with a big fear of hell, which can cause an overactive amygdala. This can effect our world view and cause us to be unable to see time or to see anything good about it which can lead to depression and other mental burdens. <br />As usual, I hope this helps,  please leave a comment below if you have something that has helped you in your journey.{% endraw %}
