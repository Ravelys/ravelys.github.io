{% raw %}In this Case Formulation Module from the APT, you'll learn how to appraise the 6 P's of case formulation: the patient's problem, pre-disposing factors, precipitating factors, perpetuating factors, positive and protective factors and of course, the plan! It enables us to form a powerful strategy to organise the information we obtain in the assessment so we can help the patient as quickly and effectively as possible. And without it, we can be very much 'stumbling in the dark.'<br /><br />Speaker: Dr William Davies, chaired by Amy George<br /><br />Dr William Davies is the Head of Applied Clinical Psychology at the APT and is the author of post qualification courses on CBT, DBT, ACT, motivational interviewing, and more. These have been attended by well over 100,000 mental health professionals in the UK alone.{% endraw %}
