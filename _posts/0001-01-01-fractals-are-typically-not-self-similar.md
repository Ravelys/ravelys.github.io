The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).<br /><br />The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose &quot;Hausdorff dimension&quot; is greater than its &quot;topological dimension&quot;.  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  <br /><br />Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.<br /><br />See Mandelbrot's book &quot;The Fractal Geometry of Nature&quot; for the full details and more examples.<br /><br />Music by Vince Rubinetti: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/riemann-zeta-function">https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/riemann-zeta-function</a><br /><br />------------------<br />3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
