{% raw %}What's my eye shape has been the most frequently asked question on my Youtube channel. I decided to do a series of videos where I will explain how to determine your eye shape. For me there are only two eye shapes, prominent and deep set. Lots of prominent eyes are also protruding which just means that they are slightly more prominent.<br /><br />Hope this video helps you. I'll be making fare more of What's my eye shape and What's my face shape videos and will cover them all, just give me some time.<br /><br />Don't be fools, don't follow makeup rules.{% endraw %}
