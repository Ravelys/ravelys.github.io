{% raw %}If a masked intruder broke into your home, would your dog attack or run away? Inside Edition put some dogs to the test to find out whether they would confront the burglar or wimp out. In a recent case, a robber kicked down the door of a home with two dogs, but instead of teaming up to take him down, the canines took off. Inside Edition tested Perry, a 5-year-old yellow Labrador. Her owner, Michelle Kellaher, loves her dog but wonders whether Perry would save her in an emergency. #InsideEdition{% endraw %}
