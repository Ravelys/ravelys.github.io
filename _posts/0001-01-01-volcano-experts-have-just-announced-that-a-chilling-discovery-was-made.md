{% raw %}Volcano experts have just announced that a chilling discovery was made inside this volcano system. Today, we take a look at what scientists found inside this volcano system.<br /><br />The United States Geological survey has said there's over 160 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S. Our history has been greatly affected by volcanic eruptions, with one of the most well known ones being that of Mount Vesuvius. In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted, destroying much of the city with volcanic debris and covering it in 19 feet of ash. For centuries the ruins of Pompeii lay undisturbed and perfectly preserved by the thick blanket of ash. In the 1700s, the discovery of the once-hidden city was revealed to the world. It was completely frozen in time. There were perfectly preserved remains of people trying to find shelter from the eruption. Even bakeries still had fresh loaves of bread in the oven.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
