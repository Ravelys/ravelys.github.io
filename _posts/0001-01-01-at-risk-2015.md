{% raw %}AT RISK is a 23-minute documentary that follows the lives of five people who are making a difference with at-risk youth, including NFL wide receiver Michael Clayton, sex trafficking survivor Niki Cross, attorney and founder of the West Florida Center for Trafficking Advocacy Brent Woody, author and creator of Pathways to Excellence Robert LeVine, who worked in juvenile detention facilities for 30 years, and law professor Judith Scully, who created the Street Law program for middle school children from predominantly poor neighborhoods. The film deals with human trafficking, runaways, bullying, poverty, depression and the lack of education that can cause a child to slip through the cracks and begin making bad decisions. The purpose of the film is to inform and inspire people to seek out a youth mentoring program in their community in order to make a difference in the life of a child who might otherwise be considered a 'throwaway'.{% endraw %}
