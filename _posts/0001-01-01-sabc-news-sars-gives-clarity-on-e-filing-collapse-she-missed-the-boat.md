{% raw %}SABC NEWS - SARS Gives Clarity on E-filing Collapse - She Missed the Boat Completely.<br />SARS’ Chief Officer for Digital Information Services and Technology, Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane.<br /><br />Cape Town - An interview with Sars' Chief of Digital and IT, Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane, on SABC's Morning Live television show on the collapse of the revenue collector's e-filing system went viral after she was unable to provide coherent answers to some of the most basic questions put to her.<br /><br /><br />Presenter Sakina Kamwendo struggled to keep the thread of the interview going as Makhekhe-Mokhuane appeared to stumble over her words, gave rambling and totally irrelevant answers, and generally appeared to be unaware of the purpose of her appearance on national television.<br /><br />Makhekhe-Mokhuane was invited to discuss the Nugent Inquiry's finding that the process of modernization which was started by Pravin Gordhan when he was at the helm of Sars came to a grinding halt as soon as Tom Moyane took over as commissioner in 2014.{% endraw %}
