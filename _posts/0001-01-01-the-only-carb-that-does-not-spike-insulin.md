Watch to learn more. <br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:25 The only carb that does not spike insulin<br />1:10 The best sources of fiber<br />1:57 The benefits of eating fiber-rich vegetables on Healthy Keto <br />3:22 Share your success story!<br /><br />In this video, we’re going to talk about the only carb that doesn’t influence insulin. <br /><br />The only carbohydrate that doesn’t influence insulin is fiber. <br /><br />The problem is, fiber-rich foods often have high carbs that do influence insulin. This includes bread, pasta, cereal, crackers, potatoes, and rice. <br /><br />Pure fat does not trigger insulin. However, carbs and excessive amounts of protein will. <br /><br />The best sources of fiber are non-starchy vegetables. <br /><br />On Healthy Keto, you want to keep your carbs under 30 grams per day. However, you do not need to count your carbs when you’re eating leafy green vegetables on keto—they contain enough fiber that the net carbs are insignificant. <br /><br />I always say that 7 to 10 cups of vegetables per day is ideal on Healthy Keto. If you have a gut issue that causes bloating, this may not be possible. <br /><br />Consuming vegetables on keto will help supply crucial nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, and phytonutrients. <br /><br />Vegetables also supply your gut with fiber, which feeds your gut microbes. A healthy gut microbiome is important for lessening insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the primary cause of weight gain and the inability to lose weight. <br /><br />In summary, you want to consume plenty of non-starchy vegetables on Healthy Keto. This is because vegetables are rich in fiber, which is the only carbohydrate that doesn’t spike your insulin. Fiber also feeds the microbes that help restore insulin sensitivity. <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
