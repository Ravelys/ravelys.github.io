{% raw %}One of the biggest complaints about the typical builder bathroom is a lack of functional storage space. One effective design idea is to include a &quot;bathroom pantry&quot;, which is simply a tall millwork unit that is larger than a medicine cabinet but smaller that a linen closet. A bathroom pantry can sit above the counter to the left or right side of the sink ? or on both sides as our example shows. This still allows for some counter space in front of the pantry, but will provide deeper and more functional storage than a typical medicine cabinet. Ideally, this type of above counter bathroom pantry should be at least twelve inches deep. Another option is to make the pantry deeper by bringing it out the full width of the bathroom counter, which would be about 22 or 24 inches deep. If the toilet is next to the bathroom counter, this millwork volume will also provide some physical separation between the sink and the toilet. This deeper type of unit also allows for linen or towel storage as well as the possibility of a ?tooth brush? storage garage at the counter level.{% endraw %}
