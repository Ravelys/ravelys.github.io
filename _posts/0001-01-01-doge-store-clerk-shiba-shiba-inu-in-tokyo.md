{% raw %}Update 11/4/2015 or 2015/11/04: It has come to my attention that the tobacco store is now closed and that Shiba has retired. I am truly saddened that you all will no longer have the chance to meet Shiba in person. But I am blessed and honored that I was able to video Shiva and for him to bring you as much happiness as he did for me.  Shiba-san, enjoy your retirement as I hope many vines of cucumbers await for you: you will be truly missed. <br />--Miki<br /><br /><br />This Shiba Inu has brought more people together from across the world than most politicians and other figures will ever be able to. Shiba's owner is the kindest owner and a great and kind person.  Shiba is the Shiba's name and he is the best dog around.<br /><br />To find Doge and the Store, enter the following address on google maps: 3 Chome-5-23 Nukui Kitamachi Koganei-shi, Tokyo-to. <br /><br />PS: Shiba is probably the best sales man in the whole world and will sell you the best things.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For any opportunities regarding this video, email me at miki.kotevski@gmail.com{% endraw %}
