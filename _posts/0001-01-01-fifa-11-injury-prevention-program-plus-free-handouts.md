{% raw %}The FIFA 11+ is effective in reducing the risk of injuries by about 40% when performed at least twice per week. Compliance to the program is key, and this can be aided by performing the running exercises before the training session as a warm up and then the strength, balance, and plyometric exercises at the end of the practice. The strength, balance, and plyometric exercises should not be performed immediately before games so that muscle fatigue does not impact performance.<br /><br />FIFA 11+ (0:00)<br />Running Exercises (0:06)<br />Set Up (0:12)<br />1.
