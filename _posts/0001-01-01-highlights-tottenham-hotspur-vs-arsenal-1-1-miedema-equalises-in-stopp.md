{% raw %}Our perfect start to the Barclays FA Women’s Super League season came to an end on Sunday as we salvaged a late 1-1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur.<br /><br />Vivianne Miedema popped up with the all-important goal deep into stoppage time - but we were ultimately made to pay for our missed chances in what was otherwise a positive attacking performance.<br /><br />With five changes to the starting XI that featured against HB Koge on Wednesday night, we made a strong start at the Hive Stadium with Beth Mead coming close inside 60 seconds, firing at the keeper after finding space down the right channel.<br /><br />Our No 9 then went on to try her luck with a free-kick from a tight angle on the edge of the area, only to see her audacious effort cannon back off the bar and on to the goal-line.<br /><br />Katie McCabe carved out our next goalscoring opportunity, rattling the woodwork with a powerful strike from 20 yards, before Miedema wriggled past three two defenders and fizzed an inviting ball across the face of goal.<br /><br />We continued to create chance after chance following the restart with Miedema coming agonisingly close at the end of an outstanding solo run - but it was the hosts who would eventually break the deadlock.<br /><br />After failing to clear our lines from a drilled delivery into the penalty area, Rachel Williams reacted first and managed to bundle the ball over the line against the run of play.<br /><br />It was a cruel blow after creating so many promising chances, but we didn’t allow it to crush our confidence, as we regained control and placed Tottenham under constant pressure for the remaining 20 minutes.<br /><br />Standing strong at the back, it looked like the hosts were set to leave with a clean sheet and all three points, but the drama was far from over.<br /><br />With one last searching corner delivery into the penalty area from McCabe, Miedema climbed high above her marker and thumped a powerful header beyond the reach of Tinja-Riikka Korpela, salvaging a late point deep into stoppage time.<br /><br />It was no less than we deserved for our performance and never-say-die attitude, but Jonas Eidevall will certainly be frustrated to have not come away with all three points.<br /><br />#arsenal #miedema <br /><br />Enjoy match highlights, training and behind the scenes to get closer to the likes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Vivianne Miedema, Nicolas Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette, Leah Williamson, Bernd Leno, Emile Smith Rowe, Nikita Parris, Tobin Heath, Mana Iwabuchi, Jordan Nobbs, Bukayo Saka, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Kim Little, Gabriel Martinelli, Aaron Ramsdale, Beth Mead, Ben White, Thomas Partey and more.<br /><br />Subscribe to the Official Arsenal YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/youtube">https://arsn.al/youtube</a><br />Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/facebook">https://arsn.al/facebook</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/twitter">https://arsn.al/twitter</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/instagram">https://arsn.al/instagram</a><br />Follow us on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsn.al/tiktok">https://arsn.al/tiktok</a><br /><br />This is the Official YouTube channel for Arsenal Football Club.<br /><br />For more match action, highlights and training videos, make sure you become a digital member and sign up to Arsenal Player.
