{% raw %}#Hisdream #CorrectiveExercises  #FixtheFace<br /><br />hey guys this is a correctional exercise routine to fix the protruding jaw.<br />The protrusion of the jaw, or so called 'underbite' can be fixed if it is acquired(that it is due to tight muscles in your face and neck, an imbalance of your muscles surrounding the mandible bone). Otherwise in the born or congenital these exercise may not be of help to you. However even in such cases, due to the tendency of the muscular-skeletal structure to move into the accustomed, comfortable direction, some of you with inborn/congenital structure may benefit from these facial exercises, as it is the way with all movements of the body - all beneficial if done the right way(amount, intensity, carefulness.<br />Daily steadiness is the key to every big and smal change. Always be joyful and thankful in all circumstances! Peace😃<br /><br />※Please be careful always not to overdo any exercise.<br />You should only move to the extent you feel comfortable and be slow and soft.<br />If any pain or discomfort is felt then you have two options : 1. Decrease the intensity to the point you feel refreshed. 2. Rest for a few days and you may start again.<br /><br />▶<br /><br />Then Abraham fell on his face <br />and laughed and said to himself, “<br />Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?<br />Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old,<br />bear a child?”<br /><br />-Genesis 17:17<br /><br />아브라함이 엎드려 웃으며<br />마음속으로 이르되<br />백 세 된 사람이 어찌 자식을 낳을까<br />사라는 구십 세니 어찌 출산하리요 하고<br />-<br />창세기 17:17<br /><br />▶<br /><br />BGM<br />&quot;Higher&quot; by LiQWYD <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/LiQWYD">https://youtube.com/c/LiQWYD</a><br />Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0<br />Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hypeddit.com/link/q2yytt">https://hypeddit.com/link/q2yytt</a>{% endraw %}
