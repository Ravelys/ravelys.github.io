{% raw %}Self made extended version of this song.<br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow<br />Sometimes I believe, at times where I should know<br />I can fly high, I can go long<br />Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know<br />Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow<br />Sometimes I believe, at times where I should know<br />I can fly high, I can go long<br />Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know<br /><br />Stop crying like you're home and think about the show<br />We're all playing the same game, laying down alone<br />We're unknown and wrong, special when I come.<br />Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow.<br />Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold.<br />It's written in our story, it's written on the walls.<br />This is our call, we rise and we fall.<br />Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?<br /><br />Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.<br />Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know.<br />I can fly high, I can go long.<br />Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know.<br />Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold.<br />It's written in our story, it's written on the walls.<br />This is our call, we rise and we fall.<br />Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?{% endraw %}
