{% raw %}This Trans Am is a beauty you want to see! Chris Ryan of Ryan's Rod &amp; Kustom came by the POWERNATION Studio with the 1978 Trans Am he restored - Mullet Missile. He took the Trans Am and replaced the cheesy, dated aspects with timeless, custom work.  From the bumpers to the interior to under the hood there is no part of this car left untouched.<br />#TransAm #SEMA{% endraw %}
