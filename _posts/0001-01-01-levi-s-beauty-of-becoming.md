{% raw %}Levi’s® Beauty of Becoming series was created and directed by Oge Egbuonu and features Naomi Osaka, Willow Smith, Jaden Smith, Brandon Flynn, Tremaine Emory, Leyna Bloom, Haben Girma, Melina Abdullah, Dolores Huerta, Melody Ehsani, Xiye Bastida, Carlos Montes, Angela Beyince, and Karla Welch with original music by Phantogram and original poetry by Aja Monet, and recounts the personal journey of becoming. The idea behind the series is to show that no one is born into greatness. Greatness is achieved through experience, self-exploration, and discovery. And nothing is more impactful than hearing the stories of those who’d achieved remarkable things, and the journeys that got them there. <br /><br />For more information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/blog/category/beauty-of-becoming/">https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/blog/category/beauty-of-becoming/</a><br /><br />For transcript: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/blog/article/beauty-of-becoming-video-transcript/">https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/blog/article/beauty-of-becoming-video-transcript/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the Levi’s® channel to watch the Beauty of Becoming Series as the stories release <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/levis">https://www.youtube.com/user/levis</a><br />  <br /><br />Or follow along on our social:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/levis/">https://www.instagram.com/levis/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LEVIS">https://twitter.com/LEVIS</a>{% endraw %}
