{% raw %}Pre-Order &quot;f̶o̶r̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶m̶a̶y̶ ̶I ̶h̶o̶pe̶? for what must we hope?&quot; here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarturl.it/FWMIHFWMWH">https://smarturl.it/FWMIHFWMWH</a><br /><br />THERE’S A LIGHT on “Elpis”:<br />“We’re excited! Not only because this is our first single of the new album but because this is our first music video ever!<br /><br />This song is about Elpis, the personification and spirit of hope in ancient Greece. We put it into another context and wrote a new story. Hope can lead you to false ends, but they were probably there from the start - you just couldn’t see them. To overcome these obstacles is the message of the song, which usually only works if there is hope left.&quot;{% endraw %}
