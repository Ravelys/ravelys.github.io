Today Dad and I are gardeners! We thought it would be a good idea to visit my Nana's and Papa's house to help them take care of their flowers, garden, and chickens! We first had to find a watering bin so that we could fill it up and give the thirsty flowers some water!! Next, we had to feed the chickens, they were so excited they were jumping all over the place!! As we were making our way through the garden we stopped by all the pretty flowers and admired their beauty! We saw merry golds, roses, lamb's ear, and we even found some gargoyles that if you watered them they came to live! We were running away from the statues when we found the giant blume box! We were so excited to open it because we love blume!! When we opened it we found so many cool things, we found a limited edition blume doll, a bracelet making kit, a dreamcatcher kit, a Petal Pet, some Blume Dolls that sprout from a pot, and some fun blume babies that smell good! It was so much fun playing with these new toys!! Thanks Blume for the fun!! #ad #blume<br />This video is sponsored by Skyrocket<br /><br />Bye vlog *pshhhhh*{% endraw %}
