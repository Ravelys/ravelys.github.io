{% raw %}On the 5th of December, 1952, an unusually heavy fog descended on London. It remained in place for five days, bringing the capital to a standstill… and yet it caused no panic. Fog was a common phenomenon within London and, dramatic as this fog was, it was thought of as just another example of typically British weather. It wouldn’t be until much later that the true cost of the Great Smog of 1952 was realised.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:43 - Background<br />02:07 - The Great Smog of 1952<br />06:54 - The Aftermath<br /> <br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past.
