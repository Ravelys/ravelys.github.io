{% raw %}Amine Edge &amp; DANCE - Porn Bass EP<br /><br />CUFF#002<br /><br /><br /><br />Amine Edge &amp; DANCE continue in their march to the top with a new EP, Porn Bass, on their own newly minted label CUFF. It's the second release on the label that has already got everyone talking, as have Amine Edge &amp; DANCE themselves. The French pair has fomented their own sound that combines elements of fat bass, hip hop soul and real house funk and does so once again in the four tracks they offer up here.<br /><br /><br /><br />Up first is 'Came around' featuring Ikaz. It's a fresh house joint with warm pads, sultry, well-treated vocals and propulsive percussion. With a teasing breakdown and hugely playful basslines that cut in and out, it's sure to set the dancefloor on fire.  Next up is 'Put It On Your Ass', a more melodically uplifting tune with glassy keys, a growling bassline and amped up vocals that bring a fresh g house vibe. <br /><br /><br /><br />'The Nine, The O, The Mother Fuckin Nine' is next a pays tribute to a certain drum machine. You can hear it in the sharp claps, the dumpy, heavy drums and playful perc. A ravey vocal is cut up and chopped in the midst of it all and a massively skewed bassline is the icing on the proverbial cake. <br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, 'Next To You' is another charming and curious track that features plenty of unpredictable elements and fresh samples that don't sound straight out of the box. It has spraying, searchlight like synths, moody bass and plenty of tin pot percussive sounds all coming together to make for one odd ass jam!<br /><br /><br /><br />This duo are injecting more personality into their music that almost anyone else, and for that reason this EP is likely to make them even more in demand around the world. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-uploaded in HD at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.TunesToTube.com">http://www.TunesToTube.com</a>{% endraw %}
