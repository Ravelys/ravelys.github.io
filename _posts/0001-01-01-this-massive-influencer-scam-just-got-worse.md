{% raw %}UPDATE: Faze Kay has been kicked out of Faze Clan! Faze Jarvis, Faze Teeqo and Faze Nikan have been suspended! Joel Morris released a statement where he admits to selling and steps down from $XCAD. <br /><br />UPDATE 2: When speaking about Faze Kayâ€™s wallet, I misspoke and said he had 6.2 billlion tokens. He actually had 6.2 MILLION tokens. Our estimations later in the video correctly accounted for this, but I misspoke in discussing KaYâ€™s holdings. Thanks to Steven Asarch for catching this mistake!<br /><br />Save the Kids was a crypto that was promoted by the top influencers in the world. <br />Faze Kay, Faze Jarvis, Faze Teeqo, Faze Nikan and Ricegum all promoted the coin, along with many other popular influencers being involved. So far, weâ€™ve had no evidence of why the coin failed until todayâ€¦.<br /><br />â–º Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT">https://twitter.com/coffeebreak_YT</a><br />â–º Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/">https://www.instagram.com/coffeebreak_yt/</a><br />ðŸŽ¶ Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&amp;list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMSQ1yoPT2c&amp;list=PL4qw3AkxFDSNhEgawXD1j6r0iN1072XIB&amp;index=1</a><br />This video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. Scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napoleon Hill pitch.<br />#savethekids #faze #crypto{% endraw %}
