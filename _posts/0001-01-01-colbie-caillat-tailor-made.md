{% raw %}A song from Colbie Caillats album Coco<br /><br />please comment<br /><br /><br /><br />lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Twenty-five,<br /><br />All of these mixed emotions,<br /><br />Tangled up in pure confusion,<br /><br />It's hard to let go of the past, but it seems,<br /><br />Easier as time is moving,<br /><br />Well you said he makes you laugh,<br /><br />And he makes you happy,<br /><br />He sees you smiling back,<br /><br />It is everlasting,<br /><br />And so he's tailor made for you,<br /><br />With stunning golden hues,<br /><br />And one sweet tone to soothe,<br /><br />Your persistent beating heart it's just a start,<br /><br />And I, have seen you everyday,<br /><br />You've never been like this before,<br /><br />He's tailor made, tailor, tailor made,<br /><br />So let go all of these mixed emotions,<br /><br />Forget all your hesitations,<br /><br />Together entwined inside this feeling,<br /><br />Feet off the ground, head hits ceiling,<br /><br />Then he whispered in your ear,<br /><br />He's absolutely falling,<br /><br />The words he said are clear,<br /><br />So don't insist on stalling<br /><br />Because he's tailor made for you,<br /><br />With stunning golden hues,<br /><br />And one sweet tone to soothe,<br /><br />Your persistent beating heart it's just a start,<br /><br />And I, have seen you everyday,<br /><br />You've never been like this before,<br /><br />He's tailor made,<br /><br />Oh sister, don't be troubled,<br /><br />Oh sister, please be calm,<br /><br />Cause this isn't, what you're used to, at all,<br /><br />He's tailor made for you,<br /><br />With stunning golden hues,<br /><br />And one sweet tone to soothe,<br /><br />Your persistent beating heart it's just a start,<br /><br />And I, have seen you everyday,<br /><br />You've never been like this before,<br /><br />He's tailor made, tailor, tailor made{% endraw %}
