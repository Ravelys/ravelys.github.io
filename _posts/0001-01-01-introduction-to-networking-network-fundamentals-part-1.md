{% raw %}Network Fundamentals Part 1: Introduction to Networking<br /><br />Interested in learning about networking? Let Network Direction help you get started.<br /><br />This video is for people that are first starting out in networking. All you need to bring is interest and enthusiasm.<br /><br />My goal of the network Fundamental Series is to help anyone wanting to get into the IT field learn more about Networking. <br /><br />We will introduce you to the terminology used in the field and help you understand what it means. For instance, have you heard of protocols? Weâ€™re going to see what these are, and use the #Ethernet protocol as an example.<br /><br />In Part 1 we'll also look at what a network actually is, and continue by seeing how devices are connected. Have you ever connected a device over Wi-Fi or plugged in Network Cables to a computer? Delve behind the scenes and find out how this works.<br /><br /><br />For further study, I reccommend (affiliate):<br />CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=RL4E*8CmbSY&amp;offerid=145238.2445867&amp;type=2&amp;murl=http://www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205804">https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=RL4E*8CmbSY&amp;offerid=145238.2445867&amp;type=2&amp;murl=http://www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205804</a><br /><br /><br />Stay tuned for part 2 where we'll go deeper into cabling, and learn the basics of addressing.<br /><br />Each section includes a quiz to get you thinking.
