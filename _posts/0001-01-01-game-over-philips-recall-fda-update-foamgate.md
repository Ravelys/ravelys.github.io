{% raw %}This could well be the end of Philips Respironics - Good Riddance! <br /><br />As the report shows. For years they have known about the significant biological risks and they did nothing! They had the complaints, they did the tests, they had the reports they talked about it in meetings and they did nothing knowing all to well that you guys were in very real danger. That is pure evil!  <br /><br />We need to move on. The time is now. <br /><br />Thanks for your support &amp; look out for one another.<br />Your mate always.<br />Uncle Nicko<br /><br />Links to the documents<br />1.
