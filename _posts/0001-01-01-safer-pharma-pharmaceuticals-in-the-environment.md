{% raw %}Pharmaceuticals in the environment are a global problem â€“ more than 600 pharmaceuticals and their metabolites have been found in the environment worldwide.<br /><br />They enter the environment (through water, soil, sludge, and organisms) at all stages of their life cycle and can end up in drinking water, and accumulate in fish, vegetables, and livestock.<br /><br />This aim of the Safer Pharma campaign is to protect the environment from pharmaceutical pollution at all stage of their life cycle.<br /><br />The campaign is coordinated by Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) Europe, a non-profit European coalition of hospitals, healthcare systems, healthcare professionals, local authorities, research/academic institutions, and environmental and health organisations whose aim is to bring the voice of healthcare professionals to the European policy debate about key issues affecting the environment.<br /><br />This video is also available in Russian: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWSkobLlvqo&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWSkobLlvqo&amp;</a>{% endraw %}
