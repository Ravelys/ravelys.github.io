{% raw %}This calculus video tutorial shows you how to calculate the average and instantaneous rates of change of a function.  This video contains plenty of examples and practice problems.<br /><br />Here is a list of topics:<br />1.  How to find the average rate of change of a function over an interval<br />2.  Instantaneous rate of change at a point<br />3.  Average rate of change - slope of the secant line between two points on a graph<br />4.  Instantaneous Rate of Change - Slope of tangent line at a single point on the curve<br />5.  Estimating the instantaneous rate of change using the average rate of change formula<br />6.  Calculating the derivative as a function using limits as the change of x approaches zero<br />7.  Determining the slope of the tangent line using limits<br />8.  Average rate of change between two points<br />9.  Finding the derivative using the limit process{% endraw %}
