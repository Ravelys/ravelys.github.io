SoFi is a fast growing fintech company with its hands in more areas than almost any company. But is has faced legal challenges recently from several lawsuits. One of those lawsuits in particular regarding their Golden Pacific Bank acquisition could cost SoFi their ability to obtain a bank charter, losing them billions in value.<br /><br />SoFi started out as a student loan company, offering graduate loans across the country. They then expanded into new areas of lending such as mortgages or personal loans. While they have since moved into new areas like financial services with their apps SoFi Money or SoFi Invest, their Galileo Technology Platform, or their credit card, lending has always been there operating in the background.<br /><br />In this video I look into SoFi's most damaging potential lawsuit, talking about the effects it could have on the company obtaining a bank charter, going over what that could mean for the company, and analyzing how likely that worst case scenario is to actually happen.<br /><br />üìà üí∏You can get free stocks by signing up for these apps:<br />‚ñ∫ Get up to $70 worth of stock from Public: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://share.public.com/fintek">https://share.public.com/fintek</a> when you use code &quot;fintek&quot;<br />‚ñ∫ M1 Finance (Get $30 when you deposit $100): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m1.finance/YIPMuDmLpBtZ">https://m1.finance/YIPMuDmLpBtZ</a><br />‚ñ∫ Robinhood (Get a Free stock when you sign up): <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://join.robinhood.com/kuranm1">http://join.robinhood.com/kuranm1</a><br />‚ñ∫ WeBull (Get 2 free stocks valued up to $2000 when you deposit $5): <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://act.webull.com/invite/share.html?inviteCode=PZmxRyn4PfPm">https://act.webull.com/invite/share.html?inviteCode=PZmxRyn4PfPm</a><br /><br />üé• My Video Equipment:<br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ziQnSL">https://amzn.to/3ziQnSL</a><br />Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TdllLI">https://amzn.to/2TdllLI</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xgPFUz">https://amzn.to/3xgPFUz</a><br /><br />üíº üèÜ VIP Investment Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fintek">https://www.patreon.com/fintek</a><br /><br />I am not a financial or investment advisor.
