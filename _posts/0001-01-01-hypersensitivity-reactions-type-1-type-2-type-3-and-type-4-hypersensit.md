{% raw %}Lecture on Hypersensitivity reaction -This lecture explains about the four different types of hypersensitivity reactions - Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and type 4 hypersensitivity which are the manifestation of allergy.<br />This video explains -<br />type 1 hypersensitivity - the cause and effect in body<br />type 2 hypersensitivity - the cause and effect in body<br />type 3 hypersensitivity - the cause and effect in body<br />type 4 hypersensitivity - the cause and effect in body<br />Before describing the mechanisms involved in allergic reactions, we will review a general scheme of classification of immune reactions proposed almost fifty years ago by Gell and Coombs.  While this scheme is quite dated in many respects, it remains widely used and can be helpful in understanding the relationships between different immune reactions,<br /><br />Under this scheme, all immune reactions are classified into one of four headings known as Types I, II, III, and IV.<br /><br />Type I hypersensitivity reactions include all of immediate hypersensitivity, the allergic reactions we will cover in detail in this chapter.  They are mostly IgE-mediated (although other Ig classes may sometimes participate), and their rapid onset, typically within minutes of exposure to antigen, is characteristic.<br />For more information, log on to-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shomusbiology.com/">http://www.shomusbiology.com/</a><br />Get Shomu's Biology DVD set here-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shomusbiology.com/dvd-store/">http://www.shomusbiology.com/dvd-store/</a><br />Download the study materials here-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shomusbiology.com/bio-materials.html">http://shomusbiology.com/bio-materials.html</a><br />Remember Shomu’s Biology is created to spread the knowledge of life science and biology by sharing all this free biology lectures video and animation presented by Suman Bhattacharjee in YouTube.
