{% raw %}An overview of the topic of requirements engineering and the scope of this course.<br /><br />This playlist is a full course in requirements engineering as I have held it for several years at CSULB. The numbered lectures are the recordings from the Learning Glass, a whiteboard simulation for distance learning. The videos in between use presentation slides to give more details and background on the contents touched upon in the learning glass recordings. The full set of lecture slides, assignment sheets, readings and practice materials is available on foss2serve.org under <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.foss2serve.org/index.php/Requirements_Engineering,_CSU_Long_Beach,_Penzenstadler">http://www.foss2serve.org/index.php/Requirements_Engineering,_CSU_Long_Beach,_Penzenstadler</a>{% endraw %}
