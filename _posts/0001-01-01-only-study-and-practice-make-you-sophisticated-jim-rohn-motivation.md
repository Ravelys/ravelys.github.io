{% raw %}Money doesn't make you sophisticated. Only study and practice make you sophisticated. Even people of modest means can become sophisticated because it is within-study and practice. How much is a night out at the symphony? About thirty dollars. You say, &quot;Poor people can't afford thirty dollars to go to the symphony.&quot; Yes, they can. It's only thirty Hershey bars!<br /><br />Don't forget to share, to motivate, and inspire other people!<br /><br />*CREDIT<br />Jim Rohn<br />Visit Jim Rohn's websites:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jimrohn.com/">https://www.jimrohn.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.jimrohn.com/">https://store.jimrohn.com/</a><br /><br />Follow Jim Rohn @:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJimRohn">https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJimRohn</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OfficialJimRohn">https://twitter.com/OfficialJimRohn</a><br /><br />Music I Am a Man Who Will Fight for Your Honor by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/honor/">http://chriszabriskie.com/honor/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/">http://chriszabriskie.com/</a><br /><br />Get 30 days FREE Ultimate Jim Rohn Audiobook Library: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dSF88M">https://amzn.to/3dSF88M</a><br /><br />More Videos ➤ : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RE0Bq0">http://bit.ly/2RE0Bq0</a> <br /><br />Make sure to subscribe, so you do not miss out on our future videos ➤: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2tgvCGV">http://bit.ly/2tgvCGV</a><br /><br />[1] This video has no negative impact on the original works (It would actually be positive for them)<br />[2] This video is also for teaching purposes.<br />[3] It is not transformative in nature.<br /><br />Disclosure: Some of these links go to one of our websites and some are affiliate links where we'll earn a small commission if you make a purchase at no additional cost to you.
