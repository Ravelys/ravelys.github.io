{% raw %}The T-44-100 is a rank IV Soviet medium tank with a battle rating of 7.0 (AB/RB/SB). It was introduced in Update 1.57 &quot;Battle March&quot;. It is a standard T-44, but with the stronger 100 mm D-10T gun, the same one as on the SU-100 and the T-54 tanks.<br /><br />This is a fast, manoeuvrable with low profile tank that should be played as a brawler, flanker and ambusher. The tank's speed is quite good in Rank IV (compare with previous version T-34-85 and Panther variants) and its gun can compete with 88 mm gun of Tiger II (amount of explosive, shell velocity).<br /><br />This tank isn't suitable for front-line roles because of the lack of armour and gun depression. Moreover, T-44-100 has a fast reverse speed, making it more of a &quot;shoot-and-scoot&quot; vehicle.<br /><br />The armour isn't very thick, however, it does have the potential to bounce some shots.<br /><br />➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wiki.warthunder.com/T-44-100">https://wiki.warthunder.com/T-44-100</a><br /><br />✅ 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟒𝟒𝟎𝐩 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲<br /><br />Battle 1 - Mozdok: (0:00)<br />Battle 2 - Maginot Line: (7:12)<br /><br />#warthunder #nukenus #T44-100{% endraw %}
