{% raw %}I had to reupload this again because seems like the video got blocked, but idk how it didn't have any blocked song. Maybe it's a youtube thing, many of you really liked the playlist so here it is thanks ðŸ˜”âœ¨ðŸ’—<br />old description:<br />Usually, when I get saturated about anything Iâ€™m listening at the moment, I listen again to some of my old music or new artists to give me a break, and not get bored ! For the moment this is my current playlist, cuz I got tired listening to japanese music xD Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™m still loving it, itâ€™s just I need to listen to something else. So, this is my own break-time playlist, and if you have one it would be cool if you share it! No matter what genre is (metal/hard rock, future bass) go ahead and share our likes :^D{% endraw %}
