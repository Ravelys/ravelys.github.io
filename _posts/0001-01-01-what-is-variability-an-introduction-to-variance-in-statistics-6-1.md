{% raw %}When we seek to organize our jumbled data, we have two important questions about our data set. Our first question is “what single number best represents our data?”  Our second question is whether the scores are packed together or spread out. The answer to our second question is going to be some measure of variability. Variability indicates how much the scores differ from one another. We will examine multiple measures of variability from simple measures of the range of the data to a mathematical measure of the average about of deviation in the data. <br /><br />This video teaches the following concepts and techniques:<br />Introduction to variability in statistics<br /><br />Link to a Google Drive folder with all of the files that I use in the videos including the Bear Handout and the StatsClass.sav dataset.
