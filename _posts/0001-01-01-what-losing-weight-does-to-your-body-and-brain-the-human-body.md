{% raw %}Special thanks to John Gunstad, professor with the Department of Psychological Sciences at Kent State University, for speaking with us about his cutting-edge research on how losing weight affects brain function. <br /><br />Following is the transcript of the video:<br /><br />Here’s what losing weight does to your body and brain.<br /><br />During the first week, you may find it easy to lose weight by simply switching to a healthier diet. But as your metabolism adjusts, you won’t burn as many calories as you used to.<br /><br />So losing additional weight will become harder.<br /><br />Making matters worse, as the fat melts away, you’ll start to experience an increase in appetite. After a meal, fat cells release a hormone called leptin into the bloodstream.<br /><br />This surge in leptin levels signals to your brain you’re full and should stop eating. But with less overall fat, people who lose weight show a measurable dip in leptin.<br /><br />Brain scans of obese patients who had lost 10% of their body weight revealed that less leptin leads to increased activity in regions of the brain that control our desire to eat.<br /><br />The result isn’t just an increased appetite but an even stronger urge to eat fatty, high-calorie foods, because your brain is trying to restore the body’s leptin levels to normal. <br /><br />However, fighting that early impulse to gorge on pizza and donuts is worth it in the long run.<br /><br />Besides the decreased risk of heart disease, hypertension, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, scientists studying overweight people discovered that losing just one pound of body weight reduces four pounds of pressure on knee joints.<br /><br />Losing excess weight also reduces strain on the blood vessels, increases blood flow to the brain, and boosts overall brain function.<br /><br />Several studies have shown that people who underwent weight-loss surgery saw an improvement in memory, concentration, and problem-solving skills in as soon as three months.<br /><br />Plus, brain scans indicate that people who lost weight and kept it off for nine months reacted differently when shown images of high-calorie foods than before they lost the weight.<br /><br />The brain regions that process reward, motivation, and taste didn’t react as strongly, whereas the areas that promote overall self-control had a boost in activity.<br /><br />So fighting those cravings early on might make them easier to control later. Turns out — like anything else — losing weight can get easier with practice.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#Weight #WeightLoss #TechInsider<br /><br />Tech Insider tells you all you need to know about tech: gadgets, how-to's, gaming, science, digital culture, and more. <br />Subscribe to our channel and visit us at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sai">http://www.businessinsider.com/sai</a><br />TI on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/techinsider">https://www.facebook.com/techinsider</a><br />TI on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/">https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/</a><br />TI on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/techinsider">https://twitter.com/techinsider</a><br />INSIDER on Snapchat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insder.co/2KJLtVo">https://insder.co/2KJLtVo</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />What Losing Weight Does To Your Body And Brain | The Human Body{% endraw %}
