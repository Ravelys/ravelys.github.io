These are not casual viewing, but are for serious students who want to understand the essential underpinning concepts of the care we give our patients.<br /><br />Notes<br />Half life       t 1/2<br /><br />Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics<br /><br />Bioavailability – the proportion of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation in unchanged form<br /><br />Half life is the time from peak plasma concentration until half is eliminated<br /><br />Clearance<br /><br />T ½  First order kinetics<br />First order elimination kinetics : &quot;Elimination of a constant fraction per time unit of the drug quantity present. The elimination is proportional to the drug concentration.&quot;<br /><br />Zero-order elimination kinetics : The plasma concentration – time profile during the elimination phase is linear (Fig. 1). For example 20 mg are eliminated every hour, independently of the drug concentration in the body. Order 0 elimination is rather less common, mostly occurring when the elimination system is saturated. Eg.<br />Alcohol<br />Phenytoin<br />Warfarin (Coumadin)<br />Heparin<br />Paracetamol (acetaminophen)<br />Over dose of aspirin (normally t ½ = 3-4 hours)<br /><br />Steady state reached after 5 – 6 half lives (3.3 half lives for 90% concentrations), therefore possible loading dose.<br /><br />Drug eliminated after 5 half lives (95% eliminated after 4.5 half lives)<br /><br />Half life t ½ of common drugs<br /><br />Noradrenaline 2 minutes<br />Salbutamol   1.6 hours<br />Morphine   2 – 3 hours<br />Methadone   24 hours<br />Gentamycin   2 – 3 hours<br />Penicillin   6 – 8 hours<br />Diazepam   24 hours<br />Fluoxetine   6 days<br />Warfarin   4 days{% endraw %}
