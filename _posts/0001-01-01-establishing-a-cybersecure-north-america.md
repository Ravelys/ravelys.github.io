{% raw %}Please join the CSIS Americas Program for a virtual discussion on the shared continental challenge of cybersecurity.<br /><br />The United States, Canada, and Mexico have a shared economic and digital future. The Covid-19 pandemic has catalyzed the transition to a more digital world, economy, and workplace. With the rise of digital commerce across borders, and within the context of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), managing shared cybersecurity issues is a challenge that will require hemispheric collaboration.<br /><br />Panelists will focus on the primary cybersecurity concerns faced by regional governments and address how North American economies can increase cybersecurity cooperation efforts as digitalization grows.<br /><br />This event was made possible through general support to CSIS.<br />---------------------------------------------<br />A nonpartisan institution, CSIS is the top national security think tank in the world. <br />Visit www.csis.org to find more of our work as we bring bipartisan solutions to the world's greatest challenges.<br /><br />Want to see more videos and virtual events?
