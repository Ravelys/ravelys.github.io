{% raw %}Most Expensive House in the US | 924 Bel Air Rd. California<br /><br />Welcome to an invitation to adventure “Billionaire” – a mind-blowing voyage of all your senses, simply the best new and innovative contemporary estate in the world!!!<br /><br />After spending lots of time on mega yachts and large private jets that can sell from $50 million to $500 million, it baffled me that no one was developing luxury real estate at those high levels for the super wealthy. I set up my real estate development company in Beverly Hills, California, to cater to the super affluent that demand the very best in life!!!<br /><br />My mission started five years ago to create the most extraordinary, exciting and dramatic contemporary estate ever built in the most beautiful place in the United States. I searched by land and helicopter to find a setting worthy of creating this masterpiece. I found it by air in the hills of Bel Air, within the platinum triangle of Beverly Hills, Holmby Hills, and Bel Air. This enclave is home to the most affluent people in the world, from Captains of industry to the Hollywood elite. The weather is unparalleled year-round, nothing but bright sunshine and stars; the lush private oasis nestled in the mountainside are talked about in nearly every corner of the earth. Built upon the single most spectacular view in California, this property has an unrivaled 270˚ view that extends from the snow-capped San Gabriel Mountains to the sun-drenched shores of Malibu. Visitors can experience the heart of Los Angeles in one expansive panorama, a singular achievement for California real estate.<br /><br />After purchasing this amazing property, the real excitement began. With my over thirty years of design experience, I wanted this to be the crown jewel of my career. My team of highly-skilled and passionate visionaries have created and sold eight amazing luxury homes in the past five years, shattering every expectation and redefining every record on the books. The goal with “Billionaire” was simple; every inch of the property in the home had to be innovative, flawless, and meticulously curated. The budget was there is no budget. To keep in line with my mission, I traveled the globe and secured the richest materials the world had to offer, taking it upon myself to personally organize each and every detail. The home technology throughout – the combination of sight, sound and security – is nothing short of cutting-edge and totally flawless. It had to be a home that would leave you in utter amazement! The house succeeds in transcending the bounds of the typical home, and dually functioning as a multi-sensory, all-powerful experience for all who enter it.<br /><br />“Billionaire” comes completely furnished like no other estate in the world. There are over a hundred incredible art installations that will leave you speechless! I could go on for days talking about this property and although I’ve provided pictures, the real experience is to visit this gorgeous home. If you truly like and demand the finest things in life, this is a must see!<br /><br />Bruce Makowsky<br /><br />LUXURY REAL ESTATE VIDEOS<br />SUBSCRIBE NOW TO OUR CHANNEL ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/triblendmedia">https://youtube.com/c/triblendmedia</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.triblendmedia.com">https://www.triblendmedia.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/triblendmedia">https://www.instagram.com/triblendmedia</a><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/tkvh0t/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/tkvh0t/</a>{% endraw %}
