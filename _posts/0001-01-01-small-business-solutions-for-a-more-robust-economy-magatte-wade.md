{% raw %}In this passionate talk, Magatte Wade urges government officials to support small businesses and  entrepreneurs in Africa. She points to fundamental and systematic problems that make it harder for a business to flourish. What can we do to prompt and use government solutions?<br /><br />TEDArchive presents previously unpublished talks from TED conferences.<br />Enjoy this unedited talk by Magatte Wade.<br />Filmed at TEDGlobal 2017.<br />NOTE: Comments are disabled on this video. We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once. (We'd love to see this change, YouTube.) So for now, if you'd like to comment on this talk, please use Facebook, Twitter or G+  to discuss with your networks.{% endraw %}
