Joshua Taylor, public information officer for the North Port Police, told PEOPLE &quot;there is a very good possibility&quot; that the 23-year-old was dead only two days after the 22-year-old was reported missing. Last month, investigators reportedly mistook Brian's mother, Roberta Laundrie, for her son. Officials had said they were aware of Brian's whereabouts during a press conference on September 16. Earlier this week, Taylor told WINK News that Brian and his mother have a similar build. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT! <br />-None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us<br />emigrantionline@gmail.com<br />before doing anything.
