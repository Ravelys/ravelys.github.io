{% raw %}We explore the BEST Bond vehicles at the Bond in Motion in Los Angeles!  THE LARGEST OFFICIAL BOND VEHICLE EXHIBIT IN THE UNITED STATES opens its doors and allows the Bond fans to immerse themselves in the world of 007's machines!  Come with us as we get up and personal with these film used vehicles AND run into a few familiar faces along the way!<br /><br />For more information on the exhibit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.petersen.org/bond">https://www.petersen.org/bond</a><br />#notimetodie #bond25 #jamesbond #007 #danielcraig #seanconnery #thebondexperience <br />_________________________________________________________________________________<br /> When David is not running an advertising and marketing company, his hobby is The Bond Experience which is primarily a video blog where he discusses Bond experiences and the people and brands that help to create those experiences... <br />The mantra of living like Bond, one moment at a time emanates from a concept of experiencing the joy of collecting small moments in life that add up to amazing journeys and stories....whether it's through style, locations, literature, fitness, and the movies themselves the world of Bond is explored through its people and their stories. <br />  Ultimately though, The Bond Experience channel is a celebration of the James Bond franchise and the many people that form a true community. Our core mission is to create a strong connection in the Bond community amongst all the fans, regardless of interest or demographic. <br />_<br />The Bond Experience is not affiliated with any James Bond copyright holder and is an unofficial entity.{% endraw %}
