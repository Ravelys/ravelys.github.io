{% raw %}Thank you to Abbott for sponsoring this video! Visit BeThe1Donor.Abbott to learn more about donating plasma.<br /><br />There is a worldwide plasma shortage because of the pandemic, and we desperately need donations. Most people seem to be familiar with the concept of donating blood, but lots of folks haven’t even heard of plasma donations, so I wanted to give you a solid introduction to what plasma is, how simple it is to donate, and what kind of impact your donations can have on the world. Any plasma questions I didn’t answer? Drop them in the comment section and I’ll try to answer what I can! <br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!<br />-Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
