{% raw %}Welcome to ForB's English lesson video! This time Kevin is going to explain how to pronounce &quot;not at all.&quot; For other videos, please check out ForB YouTube Channel. ⇒<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ForBenglish">http://www.youtube.com/user/ForBenglish</a><br /><br />★  Transcript<br />Hello, everyone. Welcome to ForB's English lesson video. I'm Kevin and today we're going to practice pronunciation of a very useful English phrase. &quot;Not at all.&quot;<br /><br /> Now, this phrase is pretty common in English but we do have to be careful in how we say it. Even though it looks like three words, when most people say it they say it like a single word. So, people won't say &quot;not-at-all.&quot; Instead, you'll often hear &quot;notatall.&quot;<br /><br />Now, as you can tell those two expressions &quot;not-at-all, notatall&quot; sound very different. So, if you can say it correctly and hear it and recognize it, it'll be very useful in speaking English with a Native speaker.<br /><br />So, let's practice. First with the first two words. &quot;not at.&quot; Here we have to be careful, especially about our T sounds. For both of these words, we don't want a very hard, sharp &quot;t&quot; sound. Instead, we're going to soften it similar to a D sound. So, you don't want to say &quot;not at&quot; which is very hard to say quickly and smoothly. <br /><br />Instead, we'll soften it &quot;nodad, nodad.&quot; So, we're gonna soften it and push the words together to say quickly. Let's give it a try. &quot;nodad, nodad.&quot; Repeat after me. &quot;nodad, nodad, nodad.&quot; So, we have to have it pretty fast but again soften that T so we can say smoothly.<br /><br />Next, we have the middle and last word, &quot;at all, at all.&quot; Again notice that T sound softened to a D and push the words together. &quot;adall, adall.&quot; Repeat after me. &quot;adall, adall, adall.&quot; <br /><br />OK. Now, let's try to put all three together, say as a single word. No sharp T, soften that D. &quot;nodadall, nodadall, nodadall.&quot; Repeat after me. &quot;nodadall, nodadall, nodadall.&quot; OK. Do you have it? Let's try three times very fast. &quot;nodadall, nodadall, nodadall.&quot;<br /><br />OK. This can be pretty tough there's those T or D sounds very close together but as I said many Native speakers will say it this way. So, if you can say it, pronounce it in the same way, you'll sound very natural. And, again it's very useful so you can hear it and understand it when other people say it. <br /><br />Well, I hope you enjoyed our video today.
