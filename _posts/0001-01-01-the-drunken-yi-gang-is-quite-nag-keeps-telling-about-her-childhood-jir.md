It talks about the story of forest rangers trudging through the mountains and forests to rescue victims even in severe weather such as heavy rains, blizzards, landslides, and typhoons. On days without helicopters, it takes more than 5 hours to carry the victims down Mount Jiri. Jun Ji Hyun is expected to play Seo Yi-kang, the best forest ranger in Mount Jiri National Park. She instinctively knows how to climb dirt roads, muddy roads, rock walls, cliffs and other terrains, and she is also very knowledgeable in climate, vegetation distribution, and soil quality. She is also familiar with trails and forest roads, and has the ability to lead the way. The people call her “Mountain ghost god&quot; and “Devil Seo.”<br /><br />Cast: Gianna Jun, Ji-Hoon Ju<br /><br />Subscribe Now: <br />iQiyi 爱奇艺: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iQiyiyt">http://bit.ly/iQiyiyt</a><br />iQiyi Vietnam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iqviyt">http://bit.ly/iqviyt</a> <br />iQiyi Thailand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iqthyt">http://bit.ly/iqthyt</a> <br />iQiyi Malaysia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iqmalayt">http://bit.ly/iqmalayt</a> <br />iQiyi Indonesia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iqidyt">http://bit.ly/iqidyt</a> <br />iQiyi Korea: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iqkorea">https://bit.ly/iqkorea</a> <br />iQiyi Arabic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iqarabic">https://bit.ly/iqarabic</a><br />iQiyi Spanish: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iqesyt">http://bit.ly/iqesyt</a><br />iQiyi TW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/iqtw_yt">http://bit.ly/iqtw_yt</a><br />iQiyi 精选: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iqiyicn">https://bit.ly/iqiyicn</a> <br />iQiyi Romance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iQiyiRomance">https://bit.ly/iQiyiRomance</a><br /><br />【iQiyi】A streaming platform providing exclusive dramas, blockbuster movies, hit variety shows and anime with multiple subtitles for FREE.<br /><br />Follow us on: <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iqiyifb">https://bit.ly/iqiyifb</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iqiyiins">https://bit.ly/iqiyiins</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/iqiyitw">https://bit.ly/iqiyitw</a><br /><br />#iQiyi #Jirisan #JunJiHyun #JuJiHoon{% endraw %}
