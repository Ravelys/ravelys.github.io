{% raw %}The Deele - Two Occasions<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />A summer love is beautiful<br />But it's not enough<br />To satisfy emotions<br />That are shared between us<br />A winter love is cozy<br />But I need so much more<br />It just intensifies my wants<br />To have a love that endures<br />'Cause every time I close my eyes<br />I think of you<br />And no matter what the season nears<br />I still love you<br />With all my heart<br />And I want to be with you<br />Wherever you are<br />I only think of you on two occasions<br />That's day and night<br />I'd go for broke if I could be with you<br />Only you can make it right<br />An autumn love is special<br />At this time of the year<br />But when the leaves are gone<br />Does that love disappear<br />I never underestimate the new love of spring<br />But I'm glad to say in my heart<br />I know my love's lasting<br />'Cause every time I close my eyes<br />I think of you<br />And no matter what the season nears<br />I still love you<br />With all my heart<br />And I want to be with you<br />Wherever you are<br />I only think of you on two occasions<br />That's day and night<br />I'd go for broke if I could be with you<br />Only you can make it right<br />I only think of you on two occasions<br />That's day and night<br />I'd go for broke if I could be with you<br />Only you can make it right<br />'Cause every time I close my eyes<br />I think of you<br />And no matter what the season nears<br />I still love you<br />With all my heart<br />And I want to be with you<br />Wherever you are<br />I only think of you on two occasions<br />That's day and night<br />I'd go for broke if I could be with you<br />Only you can make it right<br />I only think of you on two occasions<br />That's day and night<br />I'd go for broke if I could be with you<br />Only you can make it right<br />-- <br /><br /><br />Listen to more great funky classics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvfKFZOdWC4SvqpA2wfDGehHehYWWQzZu">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvfKFZOdWC4SvqpA2wfDGehHehYWWQzZu</a><br /><br />Â© 1987 SOLAR Records<br /><br /><br />#TheDeele #TwoOccasions{% endraw %}
