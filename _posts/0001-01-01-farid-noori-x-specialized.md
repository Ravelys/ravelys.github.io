{% raw %}Hear Specialized Soil Searching Ambassador Farid Noori shares his experience as cyclist from Afghanistan.<br /><br />Peace and freedom have never felt more real, and Farid Noori is not keeping it to himself.<br />Through the bicycle, Farid tasted freedom for the first time. He now fundamentally believes that this simple, noble act of pedalling may be the very thing to liberate his brothers and sisters and rewrite the story of Afghanistan, a place he still calls home.  <br /><br />Farid Noori grew up both in Afghanistan, and as a refugee in Pakistan. He recalls a childhood without any play or sports opportunities. When he came to the US as a student, Farid discovered cycling and immediately fell in love with it.<br /><br />Experiencing most of the country from the seat of his bike has been the highlight of Farid’s time in the US, while living away from home. In difficult times, he credits the bike for helping him find peace and the strength to deal with the challenges in his home country. Feeling the empowerment and the joy of cycling firsthand, he founded Mountain Bike Afghanistan, a nonprofit that gets more Afghan youth on bikes to experience the same.<br /><br />Farid’s vision is to make Afghanistan’s Hindukush Mountains a pure playground, a sanctuary for local Afghans, and a bucket list destination for mountain bikers all over the world.<br /><br />Get More from Specialized: <br /><br />Join Our Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/specialized">https://discord.gg/specialized</a> <br />Follow Us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iamspecialized/">https://www.instagram.com/iamspecialized/</a><br />Like Us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fb.com/specializedbicycles">https://www.fb.com/specializedbicycles</a><br />Follow Us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/iamspecialized">https://twitter.com/iamspecialized</a><br />Follow OUTRIDE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/outride/">https://www.instagram.com/outride/</a><br /><br />Learn More About MTB Afghanistan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mtbafghanistan.org/">https://www.mtbafghanistan.org/</a>{% endraw %}
