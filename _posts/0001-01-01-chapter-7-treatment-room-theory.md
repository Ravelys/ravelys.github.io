{% raw %}**PLEASE READ FULLY <br /><br />Purpose of the video is to help Esthetician’s review chapters in their text book to better prepare for State Bord testing, by simply reading and going over some of the material, it’s not intended to replace any teaching from any Beauty College. Every instructor does things different, Keep in mind I am in the state of Texas, also keep in mind that when in school students are to follow guidelines and might be required to do things a bit different, I teach my students the text book because that is where the state board questions come from and the goal is for them to pass their board exams. I also teach them and go over real working situations they might come across in the salon or spa. <br /><br /><br />* I am not affiliated with TDLR or PSI in any way<br /><br />PSI Bulletin Link <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://candidate.psiexams.com/bulletin/display_bulletin.jsp?ro=yes&amp;actionname=83&amp;bulletinid=173&amp;bulletinurl=.pdf">https://candidate.psiexams.com/bulletin/display_bulletin.jsp?ro=yes&amp;actionname=83&amp;bulletinid=173&amp;bulletinurl=.pdf</a><br /><br /><br />Glymed store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://glymedplus.io/home/index?store=0011298">https://glymedplus.io/home/index?store=0011298</a><br /><br />email: glamandbeyondinfo@gmail.com{% endraw %}
