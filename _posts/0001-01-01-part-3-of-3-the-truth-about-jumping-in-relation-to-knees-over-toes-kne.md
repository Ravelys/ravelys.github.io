{% raw %}My exact programs are at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://atgonlinecoaching.com:">https://atgonlinecoaching.com:</a><br /><br />Zero = no weights or equipment. Rebuild from the ground up! The first step is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/articles/knee-ability-zero-ch-1">https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/articles/knee-ability-zero-ch-1</a><br /><br />Dense = gradual use of weights and strategic equipment from this list: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/articles/the-athletic-truth-group-equipment-list">https://www.atgonlinecoaching.com/articles/the-athletic-truth-group-equipment-list</a><br /><br />Standards = 20 measurable targets of human bulletproofing! But every exercise still scales to any level.<br /><br />Advanced Zero = 50% bodyweight / 50% weights, REBUILD #2, this time at higher levels!<br /><br />I did 12 weeks each of Zero, Dense, and Standards. Now I’m on Week 5 of Advanced Zero. Then I will live out 12 weeks of advanced versions of Dense and Standards, after which I will spend 6 months training only 60 minutes of ATG exercises per week: “Continual Gains.” This will complete a 2 year route after which I believe a person could live the rest of one’s life with better results. Continual Gains could be continued, or one could go back and repeat Zero, Dense or Standards.<br /><br />Membership is $49.50/month with no long-term contract and your first month half off so you can see how you like it. It’s simple: I’ve tested this over and over and the people who actually achieve perfect form on the exercises wind up becoming beasts at helping others. I have not found a service on earth that coaches your form for a lower price than that. In fact we average under 2 hours to coach your form videos and answer your questions. I simply made the exact business that I wish had existed when I was at my worst. This has lead to 2289 knee success stories for people with chronic and hopeless conditions just like I had.{% endraw %}
