{% raw %}***UPDATE: Since we are travelling with a minor, our hotel quarantine stay has been changed to 8-9 days. It does not matter whether or not you are vaccinated. Whenever you are travelling with an unvaccinated minor, your length of quarantine is 8-9 days (RT-PCR on the 7th day). Also, ****CORRECTION: I just found out you CAN access the One Health Pass Portal to register more than 24 hours before your flight (3 days prior) BUT you have to fill out the E-health declaration form 24 hours before to get your most recent health status. ****<br /><br /><br />What happened when we arrived at the Manila airport ? We are considered non-OFW/balikbayan. There are lots of rules nowadays when travelling during the pandemic, and they're always changing! If you will be travelling to the Philippines anytime soon, this video will be informative and educational. These are the things we learned plus items we brought with us to our quarantine hotel here in the Philippines. <br /><br />HOTEL: Picasso Boutique Residences Mandatory Hotel Quarantine Makati Manila Philippines<br /><br />LINKS TO:<br /><br />Bureau of Quarantine website for travel updates<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://quarantine.doh.gov.ph">https://quarantine.doh.gov.ph</a><br /><br />List of Quarantine Hotels in Manila<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://quarantine.doh.gov.ph/boq-allowed-and-dot-accredited-quarantine-facilities-as-of-october-8-2021/">https://quarantine.doh.gov.ph/boq-allowed-and-dot-accredited-quarantine-facilities-as-of-october-8-2021/</a><br /><br />How to get your One Health Pass Scan Code 24 hours before your flight<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.onehealthpass.com.ph/e-HDC/">https://www.onehealthpass.com.ph/e-HDC/</a>{% endraw %}
