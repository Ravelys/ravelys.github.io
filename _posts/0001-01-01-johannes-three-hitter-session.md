{% raw %}A session at Skillzgym floor where I specialized my session for only three trick combos. Recently I have been training too much long combos so I need to get back at cleaning up rather than training for endurance. Legs were super sore from workout I did the previous day. Anyways just having fun and trying to stay clean.<br /><br />Song: MC Yogi - Road Home (feat Trevor Hall){% endraw %}
