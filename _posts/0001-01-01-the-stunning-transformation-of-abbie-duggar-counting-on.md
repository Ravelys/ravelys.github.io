{% raw %}Abbie Grace Duggar has never followed the conventional route that has become synonymous with other women who hail from the Duggar family. Neither has she and her husband John David lived like other typical couples from their clan as they waited until their late 20s to get married, and Abbie even pursued a career as a nurse outside the confines of their strict household. <br /><br />It is not an easy task to mark your presence and leave a strong impression when you marry into a super famous family whose every member has been in the spotlight for over a decade. But the reality star has managed to do just that in a short time with her beauty and strong personality. <br /><br /><br />Images/ Video Clips : Fair Use<br />Background Pictures: pixabay.com (No attribution required/ Free for Commercial Use)<br /><br /><br />Audio Credit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Wxckgm">http://bit.ly/2Wxckgm</a> (YouTube Audio Library)<br /><br />Contact: showbizwhispere@gmail.com<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PDQBriefing">https://www.facebook.com/PDQBriefing</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/briefingpdq/">https://www.instagram.com/briefingpdq/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BriefingPdq">https://twitter.com/BriefingPdq</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/BriefingPdq/">https://www.pinterest.com/BriefingPdq/</a>{% endraw %}
