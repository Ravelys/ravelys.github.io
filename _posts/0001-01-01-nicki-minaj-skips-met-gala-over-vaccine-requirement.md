{% raw %}Nicki Minaj skipped the MET Gala because of their vaccine requirements for attendees. The rapper says she hasn’t gotten the shot yet, and one reason she’s hesitant is that she claims her cousin from Trinidad has a friend who supposedly “became impotent” after he got the vaccine, and that “his testicles became swollen.” She’s facing backlash and ridicule for the specious claim, and has since said that she will likely have to get the vaccine before touring.{% endraw %}
