{% raw %}Hello to all,<br /><br />For once we have decided to talk about reasonably priced watches and the selection we made is totally subjective! <br /><br />Nevertheless, these 4 watches have all something a bit special and offer an interesting alternative in terms of pricepoint compared to some other timepieces we are more used to see and talk about on our channel; original moonphase, vintage feeling, going light and even taking an old movement in a new case...<br /><br />We hope you will enjoy this and can even give some ideas ;)<br /><br />All the very best and Viva &quot;reasonable&quot; Watchmaking (once in a while).<br /><br />Marc Andr√© &amp; Team<br /><br />Visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.watchestv.com/">https://www.watchestv.com/</a><br /><br />Links to the 4 brands' websites:<br /><br /> - Nivada Grenchen: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nivadagrenchenofficial.com/">https://nivadagrenchenofficial.com/</a> <br /><br /> - Christopher Ward: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.christopherward.com/">https://www.christopherward.com/</a><br /><br /> - Formex: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://formexwatch.com/">https://formexwatch.com/</a> <br /><br /> - Schnelle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tommlab.de/">https://tommlab.de/</a> <br /><br />Support us on Patreon for extra interactions and goodies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thewatchestv">https://www.patreon.com/thewatchestv</a>{% endraw %}
