{% raw %}Combine the power of monthly dividend stocks with ETF investing and you’ve got the start of a perfect portfolio, but there are more than 800 dividend ETFs that pay monthly…how do you find the best to buy? In this video, I’ll show you a simple dividend stock screener that will help find ETFs to buy and reveal the seven best funds for your money!<br /><br />Follow these and all the stocks in our 2021 Bow Tie Nation portfolio on Stockcard.

Combine that with the stress-free strategy of ETF investing and it’s hard to go wrong. But there are more than 800 dividend stock ETFs that pay monthly so we need a way to narrow the list.<br /><br />Dividends account for nearly half the total return on the stock market over time and are a source of cash flow you just don’t want to ignore. Even when stock prices fall, those dividend payments will be a source of positive returns you can reinvest or use to pay the bills.<br /><br />ETF investing gives you a stress-free way to invest in the market or different themes without having to pick individual stocks. You buy one fund that holds hundreds or even thousands of stocks, it’s low cost and you never have to worry about one company bringing down your portfolio.<br /><br />Using a new ETF stock screener, I’ll show you how to combine these two ideas and narrow your list of monthly dividend ETFs to buy. We’ll start by filtering for ETFs with a low expense ratio so they don’t cost more than they should. We’ll also screen for dividend funds that pay at least 3% to 10% annually and that make their payments every single month! Then I’ll reveal the seven best ETFs to buy that will continue to put cash in your pocket.<br /><br />Must Watch Videos! 😲 Don't miss the most popular videos on the channel!<br />🤑 7 Monthly Dividend Stocks that Pay My Rent! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Rr4A51xoOZ0">https://youtu.be/Rr4A51xoOZ0</a><br />8 Simple Steps to Start Investing RIGHT NOW! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oRxz_0s875I">https://youtu.be/oRxz_0s875I</a><br />💰 10 Penny Stocks Under $5 that WILL Make You Rich! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7B0Rr4n6e_4">https://youtu.be/7B0Rr4n6e_4</a><br />How Many Shares to Buy to Make $1000 a Month? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GnAuLqO6bfs">https://youtu.be/GnAuLqO6bfs</a><br /><br />🤑  Get The Weekly Bow-Tie - my FREE weekly email newsletter sharing market updates, trends and the most important news!
