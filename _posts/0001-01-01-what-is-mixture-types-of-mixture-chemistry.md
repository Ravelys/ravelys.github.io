{% raw %}In thi animated lecture, I will teach you about mixture, types of mixture, homogeneous mixture, heterogeneous mixture, examples of mixture, what is mixture in chemistry, what is mixture in science, what is mixture and its types, definition of mixture, definition of homogeneous mixture, definition of heterogeneous mixture, examples of mixture, examples of homogeneous mixture, examples of heterogeneous mixture, etc. <br />Also, you will learn the two types of mixture with examples. <br /><br />Q: What is a mixture?<br />Q: What is mixture in chemistry?<br />Q: Define Mixture?<br />Q: Explain mixture with examples?<br />Q: Whay is mixture in science?<br />Ans: When two or more than two substances are combined together physically in any ratio is called as mixture. Mixture is formed due to physical combination of different substances. In the definition, by any ratio means that whatever amount of substances you combine together physically, you get a mixture.<br />For example, when you dissolve sugar in the water you get a sugar solution which is a mixture. Air is also an example of mixture, carbonated drinks are also example of mixture.<br /><br />Q: What are the two types of mixture?<br />Q: Explain the types of mixture?<br />Q: Define the types of mixture?<br />Ans: There are two types of mixture: homogeneous mixture and heterogeneous mixture. OR. You can say that mixture has two types. <br /><br />Q: What is homogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Give examples of homogeneous mixture.<br />Q: Define homogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Explain homogeneous mixture?<br />Ans: A mixture which has uniform composition throughout its mass is called as homogeneous mixture. A homogeneous has uniform composition throughout its mass. Secondly, the particles of homogeneous mixture can not be seen with naked eye.<br />Some examples of homogeneous are:<br />1) Air<br />2) Salt Solution<br />3) Carbonated drinks <br />4) Vinegar.<br /><br /><br />Q: What is heterogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Define heterogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Give examples of heterogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Explain heterogeneous mixture?<br />Ans: A mixture which has non uniform composition throughout its mass is called as heterogeneous mixture. A heterogeneous mixture has non uniform composition throughout its mass. Secondly, the particles of heterogeneous mixture can be seen with naked eye. <br />Some examples of heterogeneous mixture are:<br /><br />1) Oil in the water<br />2) Small pebbles in the water<br />3) Pizza<br />4) Chicken noodle soup.<br /><br /><br />To learn more about mixture and types of mixtures, watch this lecture till the end. <br /><br />#Mixture<br />#WhatIsMixture?<br />#TypesOfMixture<br />#Chemistry<br />#NajamAcademy<br />#HomogeneousAnd HeterogeneousMixture<br /><br />Subscribe my channel at:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Youtube link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Najamacademy/">https://www.facebook.com/Najamacademy/</a>{% endraw %}
