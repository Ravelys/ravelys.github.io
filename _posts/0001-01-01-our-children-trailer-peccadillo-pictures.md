{% raw %}OUT IN CINEMAS 10TH MAY 2013 IN THE UK &amp; IRELAND.<br /><br />Directed by Joachim Lafosse and starring Emilie Dequenne, Tahar Rahim and Niels Arestrup.<br /><br />Based on true events, celebrated director Joachim Lafosse's intense, multi-layered dissection of an unorthodox family unit created an unprecedented buzz at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, and won Emilie Dequenne the prestigious Un Certain Regard Best Actress Award.  OUR CHILDREN was critically heralded as one of the top art-house world cinema films of 2012 and Belgium's official entry for the 2013 Academy Awards.  <br /><br />Young, and full of life, Murielle (Emilie Dequenne, Rosetta) has a promising future ahead of her when she meets and falls head over heels for Mounir (Tahar Rahim, A Prophet). A wedding soon follows, and the happy couple quickly set about preparing to make a family. However, with family comes ties, and none come so tight as that between Mounir and his adoptive father (Niels Arestrup, A Prophet, Sarah's Key). As Murielle continues to bring new life into the family, in the form of four children, frictions between Mounir and Doctor Pinget reach boiling point. Helpless to extract her husband and children from the wealthy nest that Doctor Pinget has provided for them, Murielle is drawn into an unhealthy family dynamic. There is only one way out of this nightmare, and for Murielle, all sense of reasoning begins to abandon her.{% endraw %}
