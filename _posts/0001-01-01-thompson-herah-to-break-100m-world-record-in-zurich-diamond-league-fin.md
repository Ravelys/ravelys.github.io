{% raw %}Elaine Thompson-Herah has the talent, the track, and the conditions to finally break Florence Griffith Joyner's 100m world record at the Diamond League final in Zurich, according to fellow sprinter Andre De Grasse.<br />A fortnight ago Thompson-Herah ran 10.54 sec in Eugene – the second fastest time in history and just 0.05sec off Flo-Jo’s record. And De Grasse, who won gold in the 200m in Tokyo, believes she can make history given the warm weather and the newly resurfaced track at Letzigrund Stadium.<br />“The track is really nice,” said De Grasse. “I did a couple sprint sessions on it on Tuesday so I think it’s possible. I saw Elaine run at Prefontaine on a very fast track and she ran exceptionally well. So I think with the right conditions, the way the weather is, the crowd, I think everything is just gonna amplify that. It’s definitely possible.”<br />Thompson-Herah, who spent lockdown studying Griffith Joyner and Usain Bolt's old races for technical improvements, is now the fastest woman alive and the 100m and 200m champion. She believes, however, that there is still room for improvement. “I need to nail my start for the 100m and I haven’t nailed it yet,” she said.<br />The Jamaican will compete against Dina Asher-Smith of the United Kingdom, who is back to her best after suffering a hamstring injury five weeks before the Olympics. Only an hour later, Asher-Smith will compete in the 200m, where she will face Christine Mboma, an 18-year-old Namibian sensation, and Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson.<br /><br />DHK TV is a YouTube channel that brings you the latest news, sports, celebrity news, and much more.<br />Subscribe: Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/c/DailyHumorKE">http://www.youtube.com/c/DailyHumorKE</a><br /><br />Artist: Kalvin Plaza <br />Song: Where do we go from here?<br />Music Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9s_y7eqy9C_AFU78EAEk7w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9s_y7eqy9C_AFU78EAEk7w</a><br />Original Video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x2_du18MdFQ">https://youtu.be/x2_du18MdFQ</a>{% endraw %}
