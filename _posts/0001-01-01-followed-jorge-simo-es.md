{% raw %}Join our day with Jorge Simoes as we visit his mom's hair salon, hit spots, nerd out on cars and let the day fade out with some more skating. <br />There is no doubt Jorge is one of Europe’s most skillful skateboarders. Often with people who can get all the attention with their skating, we don’t know too much about their personal lives. This is exactly why we wanted to give you a peek into Jorge’s life to see what he does and likes besides skateboarding. Enjoy.<br /><br />Also Featuring Gabriel Fortunato<br /><br />Filmed by Daniel Galli<br />Edited by Bennet Rahm<br />Photos by Thomas Bauman<br /><br />Get our books &amp; apparel collection here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/">https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/</a><br /><br />Feel free to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag">http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pocketskatemag.com">http://www.pocketskatemag.com</a>{% endraw %}
