{% raw %}The Misconception Song<br /><br />Music and Lyrics by George Hrab<br /><br />Directed and edited by Nicolas Calabrese<br /><br />featuring: Taylor Beichy, Milan Starchild, &amp; Erin McGuire<br /><br />Thanks to Kemmerer Graphics, Spring Shank, The City of Bethlehem<br /><br />The Misconception Song<br /><br />You don’t know what you think you know, <br />what you think you know is often wrong<br />You don’t know what you think you know, <br />but you could know what is in this song<br /><br />You don’t seal in juices by searing meat, <br />you don’t get headaches from too much MSG, <br />there’s a fifty day shelf life for each Twinkie, <br />though you probably thought they’d last an eternity, <br />the historical buddha was not a fat guy, sharks can get cancer before they die<br />and though some textbooks say it’s true, the blood in your veins is at no point blue<br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />Let them eat cake was never said by Marie Antoinette<br />Marco Polo did not bring home “spaghett!”<br />Just because dogs pant doesn’t mean they don’t sweat<br />the pads on their paws get a teeny-tiny bit wet<br />bats are not blind they have limited sight, <br />did you know Napoleon was of average height?<br />The Chevy Nova was a hit and did sell, in Mexico and Venezuela as well<br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />Edison did not invent the incandescent light<br />Ford did not invent the car or build the first assembly line sight<br />and how about James Watt- did he invent the steam engine? Not.<br />And though I know that you say that you swear you’ve seen it-<br />George Washington Carver did not invent the peanut<br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />Sugar does not cause hyperactivity, Glass does not flow super slowly<br />Rust does not cause tetanus you see if you wanna wake a sleep walker, hey feel free<br />Hair doesn’t grow thick after it’s shaved off, <br />cough medicine rarely ever helps a cough-<br />folks go on and on, about the Parthenon, <br />but the Golden Ratio was never ever drawn<br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />Albert Einstein never failed a single math test<br />A cop doesn’t have to say he’s a cop if he’s pressed<br />Milk doesn’t cause phlegm to come up out of your chest<br />lemmings don’t kill themselves, who’d a guessed, <br />it’s OK to crack your knuckles no damage will be done, <br />you can taste ev’ry taste ev’rywhere on your tongue<br />Let me say one thing no one can rebuke, a <br />vomitorium’s an exit and not a place to puke<br /><br />CHORUS<br /><br />Marconi did not invent the radio<br />Did Thomas Crapper invent the flush toilet? No, no, no.<br />But using their brains and persistence<br />they improved stuff already in existence, and yet- <br />for some reason this myth remains that<br />human beings only use 10% of their brains<br /><br />Humans use 100% of their brains, Humans use 100% of their brains, <br />stop saying humans only use 10% of their brains, ‘cause humans use<br />seriously- if you take away one thing from this silly song it’s the simple fact that:<br />humans use 100% their brains- KEY CHANGE!<br /><br />You don’t know what you think you know<br />but now you know what you think could be wrong<br />now you know what you think could be wrong <br />‘cause you listened to all of the stuff in this song<br /><br />-And now we’re all slightly less wrong.{% endraw %}
