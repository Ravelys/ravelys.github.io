{% raw %}Tapping on the camera and lens with long acrylic nails. I don't know why I find these camera sounds to be so tingly, but I do! And I hope you do, too!<br /><br />If you'd like to see what I make next, hit that subscribe button!

Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. <br /><br />What is ASMR? To me, it's a really cool sensation that some of us get in response to some auditory (sound - whispers, tapping, hand sounds) or visual triggers (hand movements, watching someone focus, draw, paint, etc. or personal attention). For some it's a tingling or vibrating feeling often felt in the head, neck, shoulders, and/or back, and can change based on different triggers. It can feel like a tingly scalp massage or just a relaxing feeling all over. <br /><br />For people who don't experience the ASMR tingles, these videos can still be helpful to destress, relax, or as a sleep aid.{% endraw %}
