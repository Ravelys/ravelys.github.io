{% raw %}DISCLAIMER: THIS VIDEO IS NOT MONETISED AND IS NOT BEING USED FOR MONETARY GAIN!<br /><br />Some quick explanations<br /><br />TETRATION<br />Tetration is used to define multiple powers. Basically, I can use Tetration to shorten 5↑5↑5↑5 to 5↑↑4. To put it simply: Tetration is to powers what powers are to multiplication.<br /><br />FACTORIALS<br />If I say 10!, That would mean 10 Factorial, which is equal to 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 (which would equal 3628800). That would mean a Faxul would be 200*199*198*197* ... *3*2*1, which would ultimately give you a BIG number!{% endraw %}
