Conduct investigative tasks to uncover the identity of the killers. But be careful, it won't be easy: the killers are part of the group and will stop at nothing to bring the investigation to a standstill!<br /><br />Between the rounds, you and the other players discuss who the killers might be. Everyone is a suspect in this social inference game. Discuss live with other players using the integrated voice chat function. Where was the body? Where were you? What tasks did they do? Who were you traveling with? Who acted suspiciously?<br /><br />After the discussion, it's time to vote. Use your gut instinct to evict the suspect from the mansion. But be careful: if you suspect another innocent guest and kick him out of the mansion, you are helping the killers win the game!<br /><br />You can either play the game with your closest friends or with other players of a similar skill level that the game determines for you.<br /><br />This game is constantly evolving and new maps, tasks and features are waiting for you. Suspects is a game where friends and family can have fun together!<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />All Videos on that channel are 13+ (COPPA).{% endraw %}
