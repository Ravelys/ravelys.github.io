{% raw %}Brockwood Park 1976 - Public Talk 1 - A transformation which implies freedom<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Can there be a radical transformation in the content of our consciousness?<br /><br />Am I separate from the content of my consciousness? If the observer is the observed, what occurs?<br /><br />Can I be totally free of psychological fears? <br /><br />Does fear exist apart from the word and idea, or is it a structure of words, ideas and time? <br /><br />What is the nature of thinking?<br /><br />Can the mind be free of time, idea and the word? <br /><br />What takes place when you observe that fear is you?<br /><br />When there is complete attention which is total energy then is there fear?<br /><br />All this is meditation.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
