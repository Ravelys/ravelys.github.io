It is 4K Ultra HD (UHD) at 60fps (60 frames per second) to create the highest quality dark special VFX (visual effects) possible. Try using it as a Kinemaster editing video template, or in Premiere Pro video edits, or as an After Effects motion graphic! Consider using it for VJ loops, meditation, backdrops, edm concerts and much more. Also, think about all the cool tunnel projects you can make! It's great for intros, openers, moving backgrounds, wallpapers, music videos, lyric videos, video edits, glow videos and neon effects. It can also be used at events, kiosks and show booths. Beeple VJ loop visuals have always been a huge inspiration to me. This background video can be extended infinitely to play for any duration in all video editors, like Kinemaster, Premiere Pro, or Sony Vegas. What amazing, beautiful love projects will you use this visual effect for?<br /><br />For business inquiries, or to purchase for commercial use, please contact me directly.
