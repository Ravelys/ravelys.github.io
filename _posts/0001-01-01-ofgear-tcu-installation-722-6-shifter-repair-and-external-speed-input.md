I found out that<br />my W-S switch was not working so i dismantled it and did a full clean up.<br />And got it working again<br /><br />the shifter has 3 connectors . 2 connectors are not inlcuded with the controller<br />The Reverse/Park Lock and the Reverse back-up light switch<br />See below the pictures with the part numbers that can be ordered by mercedes incl the<br />connector internals.<br /><br />On my shifter also my Reverse/Park lock solenoide is broken so i ordered a new one<br />I have also a ABS sensor installed. This is a OEM R129 wheelspeeds sensor .<br />This signal can be used as a input on the Ofgear controller<br />follow the link for how to connect this<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ofgear.dk/userguide/rpmkmin.html">http://ofgear.dk/userguide/rpmkmin.html</a><br /><br />I have also my Electronic speedo connected to the Ofgear controller .<br />This speedo will later be placed in the W201 dashboard.<br />How to connect this speedo to the Ofgear controller<br />follow this link<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ofgear.dk/userguide/speedoout.html">http://ofgear.dk/userguide/speedoout.html</a><br /><br />What is very important<br />is that if you change settings for the speed sensor input and speed signal output to the<br />speedo you need to do this for the W-mode and also for the S-mode<br />Because there are 2 programs that can be used so the both need to be programmed for this<br />otherwise it will not work<br /><br />If you want more info about this Controller or Shifter or how to adjust it<br />you can always ask.<br />Or have a look on<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ofgear.dk/">http://ofgear.dk/</a><br /><br />Music By MAXWELL: We Roll{% endraw %}
