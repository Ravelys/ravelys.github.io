{% raw %}An eyewitness on the scene told The Sun that the tragedy was recorded on camera as the cast and crew did a take rehearsing their scene. <br />The insider claimed: “The camera was facing Alec who was shooting in the cameras general direction during a rehearsal scene that was being recorded. <br />&quot;The cameras captured Alec shooting but Halyna and Joel were behind the camera so I don’t think the cameras captured them being shot.”<br />However, “cameras, lights and props were damaged” from the gunfire with “broken glass was everywhere,” so it is unclear if the footage would be salvable. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3914033/alec-baldwin-shooting-captured-camera-gun-killed-cinematographer/">https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/3914033/alec-baldwin-shooting-captured-camera-gun-killed-cinematographer/</a><br /><br />Alec Baldwin's Accidental Shooting That Killed 'Rust' Movie Crew Member Was 'Captured On Camera'<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://radaronline.com/p/alec-baldwin-accidental-shooting-killed-movie-crew-captured-camera/">https://radaronline.com/p/alec-baldwin-accidental-shooting-killed-movie-crew-captured-camera/</a><br /><br />Souza and Russell both told the sheriff's detective that after camera operators walked off the Rust set, citing housing and pay issues, they were down to one camera, and it was not filming when Baldwin's gun discharged.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/alec-baldwin-practicing-drawing-supposedly-102051612.html">https://www.yahoo.com/now/alec-baldwin-practicing-drawing-supposedly-102051612.html</a><br /><br />&quot;The scene did not call for Defendant Baldwin to shoot the Colt Revolver,&quot; the suit filed by Serge Svetnoy states. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/alec-baldwin-wasnt-supposed-pull-224208577.html">https://news.yahoo.com/alec-baldwin-wasnt-supposed-pull-224208577.html</a><br /><br />Baldwin ‘Rust’ shooting: Famed lawyer says he’d be shocked if involuntary manslaughter charge not brought <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/alec-baldwin-shooting-criminal-defense-lawyer-mark-geragos-charges">https://www.foxnews.com/media/alec-baldwin-shooting-criminal-defense-lawyer-mark-geragos-charges</a><br /><br />Deputies responding to a 911 call about a &quot;gunshot trauma&quot; at the ranch learned the gun had been handed to an armorer, a worker who handles weapons for a movie set, following the shooting.
