{% raw %}Jadé Fadojutimi’s ‘A Muddled Mind That’s Never Confined’ is a wonderfully poetic and mysteriously abstract piece that is just one of the highlights of Sotheby’s upcoming Contemporary Art Day Sale (8-15 October 2021). In this latest Sotheby’s video, Contemporary Art specialist Witt Kegel describes how Fadojutimi takes inspiration from music, fashion and anime to create an image with both sweeping and intricate brushstrokes. Discover how it is both an eruption of colour and a visual representation of her response to the world around her. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/sothebys/?sub...">https://www.youtube.com/sothebys/?sub...</a><br /> <br />FOR MORE NEWS FROM SOTHEBY’S<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sothebys/">https://www.instagram.com/sothebys/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sothebys">https://www.facebook.com/sothebys</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sothebys">https://twitter.com/sothebys</a>{% endraw %}
