{% raw %}Jason Sudeikis does *NSYNC's iconic &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; dance in season two of &quot;Ted Lasso,&quot; and he explained to Ellen that he actually didn't have to learn that much of the choreography for his hit series. The Emmy winner also talked about the one-of-a-kind gift he received from Ellen the first time he was on her show, and returning to his roots at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to host the show for the very first time.<br /><br />Check your local listings to watch Ellen today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ellen.tv/3BOuzz4">https://ellen.tv/3BOuzz4</a><br />Subscribe to The Ellen Show: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/theellenshow?sub_confirmation=1">https://youtube.com/theellenshow?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />#Ellen #TheEllenShow #JasonSudeikis #NSYNC #EllenDeGeneres{% endraw %}
