{% raw %}These knee strengthening exercises don't require using a lot of weights. If you have knee pain, consider using knee compression sleeves to help increase circulation and reduce swelling &amp; pain. Purchase the Titan Compression knee sleeves here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2pojTED">http://amzn.to/2pojTED</a> (affiliate link)<br /><br />Knee compression sleeves will also give the knees some compression during the exercises to help the healing process. <br /><br />The first exercise to help strengthen the knee is a short arc quad (SAQ), this is a great way to get started without doing to much to the knee. It helps strengthen the quad muscles with extend or straighten the knee.<br /><br />The next knee strengthening exercises are a bridging series including a regular bridge, bridging with a band, and bridging squeezing into a ball. These all are great for the hamstrings, glutes, and surrounding muscles of the knee and hips.<br /><br />Then you will do a long arc quad (LAQ), this is like the SAQ, but it is a longer arch with works the quad muscles in a bigger range of motion.<br /><br />The final two exercises for the knee are a squat and a squat with a band. Squats do a great job of strengthen all of the lower leg muscles including hamstrings, quads, glutes, hip flexors, and others. <br /><br />Related Videos:<br /><br />Knee Strengthening Exercises:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usv1mzDxdTw&amp;list=PLPS8D21t0eO8bRyNBvm5NULZeCKPsnP3Q&amp;index=28&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usv1mzDxdTw&amp;list=PLPS8D21t0eO8bRyNBvm5NULZeCKPsnP3Q&amp;index=28&amp;t=0s</a><br /><br />Real Time Knee Pain Stretches &amp; Exercises:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkOwuoJCAuQ&amp;index=39&amp;list=PLPS8D21t0eO8bRyNBvm5NULZeCKPsnP3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkOwuoJCAuQ&amp;index=39&amp;list=PLPS8D21t0eO8bRyNBvm5NULZeCKPsnP3Q</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />SUPPORT me on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo">http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo</a><br /><br />===========================================<br /><br />7 Best Knee Strengthening Exercises:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOrc3zADC7k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOrc3zADC7k</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.
