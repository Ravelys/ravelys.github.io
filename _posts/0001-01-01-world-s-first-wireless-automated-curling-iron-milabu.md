{% raw %}World's First WIRELESS AUTOMATED Curling Iron<br /><br />Yes, we got our hands on one of the first wireless automated hair curling tools. This is very exiting, I love the concept of wireless hair tools! BUT, does it live up to the hype that comes with wireless tool! I'm gonna put this hair curling iron through the ringer and see what kind of results it produces. Let me know what you think about this tool - you can find it on Indiegogo under 'magic rod'.<br /><br />Subscribe for more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2oKMW4f">http://bit.ly/2oKMW4f</a><br /><br />Products Used/Mentioned: <br /><br />Magicrod <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/30UdUIs">http://bit.ly/30UdUIs</a><br /><br />*Some links (rstyle, amzn, shopstyle, shrsl...) above are affiliate links.
