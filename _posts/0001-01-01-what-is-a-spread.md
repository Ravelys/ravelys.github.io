{% raw %}The price difference between a securities' sell (bid) and buy (ask) price. All markets including foreign exchange, futures and equity markets have a spread. The size of the spread reflects the market's liquidity and transparency. For example when there are a lot of buyers and sellers in the market, the spread tends to be smaller, whereas fewer buyers and sellers make the spread larger.<br /><br />By Barry Norman, Investors Trading Academy.{% endraw %}
