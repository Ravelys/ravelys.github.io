The father was the breadwinner, which supported his wife and their ever growing family.<br /><br />On average, gas cost 18 cents per gallon at the start of the 1950s and 25 cents per gallon at the end of the decade.<br /><br />The economy was booming, new cars, suburban houses and other consumer goods were available to more people than ever before.<br /><br />Car culture took off in the 1950s. President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act in June of 1956 to create 41,000 miles of national highways. This made family road trips possible!<br /><br />Televisions became something the average family could afford. The Golden Age of Television was marked by family-friendly shows like I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Twilight Zone and Leave It To Beaver.<br /><br />The 1950s saw the emergence of Rock ‘n’ Roll, which swept across the nation.<br /><br />The booming prosperity of the 1950s helped to create a widespread sense of stability in the United States. That consensus was a fragile one, and would be tested in the following decade.{% endraw %}
