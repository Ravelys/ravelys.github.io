{% raw %}Of all the scenarios that keep astrophysicist Sandra Faber up at night, it’s not the Earth’s increasing volcanism, the loss of photosynthesis, or even the impact of a massive asteroid. Rather, it’s the collapse she’s certain will result from the unbridled growth of the world’s economies.<br /><br />Join Faber and EconTalk host Russ Roberts as they explore what the most inexorable law of physics has to do with economics and whether the world’s growing economies pose a problem or provide the solution for the finiteness of planet Earth. <br /><br />For links and more information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.econtalk.org/sandra-faber-on-the-future-of-the-earth/">https://www.econtalk.org/sandra-faber-on-the-future-of-the-earth/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to EconTalk on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKAu-mTq7iZtKHK6QiBqKPA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKAu-mTq7iZtKHK6QiBqKPA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Subscribe to the audio episodes:<br />Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/econtalk/id135066958">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/econtalk/id135066958</a><br />Stitcher: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/econtalk">https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/econtalk</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4M5Gb71lskQ0Rg6e08uQhi">https://open.spotify.com/show/4M5Gb71lskQ0Rg6e08uQhi</a><br />and wherever you listen to podcasts.{% endraw %}
