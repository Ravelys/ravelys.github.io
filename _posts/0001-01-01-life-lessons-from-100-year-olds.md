{% raw %}We asked three unique and lovely centenarians what their most valuable life lessons were, and also their regrets.<br /><br />The conversations that followed were remarkable. They talked about the importance of family, people, relationships and love. Their view on life, as an elderly citizen with a lot of experience is truly an inspiration and motivation. Enjoy the video!
