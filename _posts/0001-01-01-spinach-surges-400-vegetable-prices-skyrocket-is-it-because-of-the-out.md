{% raw %}On November 1st, 2021, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a notice urging local governments to stabilize food prices and ensure the supply of vegetables and other essential goods this winter and next spring. <br />The notice also encourages households to store essential goods based on their daily needs and for unexpected situations. The move sparked all sorts of worries online, with comments linking it to the spread of Covid in China, the expected onslaught of a cold snap, and even tensions in the Taiwan Strait. <br /><br />Have questions?
