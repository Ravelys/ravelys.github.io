{% raw %}Complete coverage of the Duel, the 7th and final event of the Women's Individual competition at the 2021 Rogue Invitational, from Dell Diamond in Round Rock, Texas (Sunday, October 31). The Duel is a single-elimination bracket event in which the top 5 women on the leaderboard earn an automatic bye into Round 2. The workout itself has a 90-second time cap and includes a sequence of double-unders, squat snatches, and a sand bag lift. <br /><br />Much like the men's division, the women's title was very much up for grabs at the very end, with the inspiring Annie Thorisdottir giving defending champ Tia-Clair Toomey her greatest challenge in years. In a mirror of what happened to Pat Vellner on the men's side, though, one small mistake proved the difference for Annie, as Toomey was able to win the Duel outright and secure the points she needed (625 to 560 in total) to best Thor's Daughter. Tia has now won every Rogue Invitational women's title since the competition's inception in 2019.<br /><br />Details of the Workout:<br />Single Elimination Head to Head Bracket<br />60 Heavy Double Unders<br />3 Squat Snatch (145 LBS)<br />1 Sand Bag Load to 44&quot; Platform (165 LBS)<br /><br />You can follow more of the 2021 Rogue Invitational, including exclusive videos, leaderboards, and full workout schedules at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.roguefitness.com/invitational">https://www.roguefitness.com/invitational</a>{% endraw %}
