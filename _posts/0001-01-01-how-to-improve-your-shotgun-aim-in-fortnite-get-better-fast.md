{% raw %}In this video, I give my all-inclusive guide on how to improve your shotgun aim in Fortnite. This has been a topic I've wanted to cover for a while, so because I have already made guides on improving your mechanics and fighting, I thought the next one should be on your shotgun aim. Now you guys probably experience this already, but your shotgun aim is arguably the hardest skill in Fortnite to improve at and master. What I did was I compiled all the best shotgun aim tips and tricks, shotgun aim trainer, creative maps, and everything else pros use to improve their shotgun aim. This will include Pandvil's Headshot Only Free-For-All, Kovaak's Aim Training Drills for your shotgun aim, Skavook's Aim Training Map, Shotgun warm up drills, Noahreyli's shotgun maps in-game like Tile Frenzy from Xanex60, and even late game solo arena. So, if you're looking to improve your shotgun aim and get better shotgun aim in Fortnite, then watch this video and go practice.
