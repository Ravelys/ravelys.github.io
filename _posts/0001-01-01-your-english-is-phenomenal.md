{% raw %}I'm upset at the fact that nct 127 is getting treated horribly while they're in america. This question is disrespectful to both nct and bts and it makes me upset. But this made me laugh like...do research. Or let someone who actually knows the group interview them lol. <br /><br /><br />Hellooooo!! How is everyone? :) <br />I'm hoping everyone has a good day. <br /><br />°·°·°·°Follow me°·°·°·°<br /><br />Г Instagram: alyssaeprice<br />Г Twitter: axmult1{% endraw %}
