{% raw %}This is one of several clips I will be uploading from an colab I did with Allen Parr evaluating a few different religious groups in light of biblical Christianity. Subscribe to my channel to get notified when the other videos in this series go up. <br /><br />We are using the word “cult” here in the popular negative sense that Christian theology uses; to indicate a religion which imitates Christianity but is not genuinely Christian. The term also has another technical meaning; referring to any religion that has rituals associated with it. That’s not the definition we intend in this video. <br /><br />If you enjoyed this you will probably enjoy a lot of the content that Allen Parr has. Here is his channel, I recommend you check it out. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_RMW_fQk-ELpPYUzor8lw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm_RMW_fQk-ELpPYUzor8lw</a><br /><br />Allen's interview with a former Mormon named Micah Wilder <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/StXOOhYZvEI">https://youtu.be/StXOOhYZvEI</a><br /><br />My website.
