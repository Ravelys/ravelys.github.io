The team is preparing to release a CD recording new songs for the radio, in parallel preparing a new program for the recital.<br /><br />Subscribe to &quot;Indigo Choir&quot; official channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL2gQe8svalCAFrNObJ2VNA?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL2gQe8svalCAFrNObJ2VNA?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
