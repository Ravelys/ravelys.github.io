{% raw %}Have you ever wondered how much money you have in your wallet at the end of the month? Here is a ranking of the largest cities in the UK based on the salary calculator per employee and their costs.<br /><br />Be aware that this is AVERAGE wages and this ranking shows poorest to richest UK workers per city. The list starts with those with the lowest incomes and ends with cities, which have the richest employees. Especially intersting stats concern London - the capitol is realy expensive!<br /><br />For more information, see the below link to the source.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />I'm a great fan of big data, stupid data, all stats and of course llamas. If you would like more movies like this to appear on this channel, it would be nice if you subscribed me.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Sources: www.cv-library.co.uk/recruitment-insight/revealed-richest-poorest-cities-uk/{% endraw %}
