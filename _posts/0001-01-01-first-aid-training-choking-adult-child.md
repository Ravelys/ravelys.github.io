Their airway can be partly or fully blocked. Usually, choking in small children is caused by a small foreign object whereas in adults it is most commonly food. If the blockage of the airway is mild, the casualty should be able to clear it by coughing. Any blockage of the airway should be taken very seriously as within a short time of the brain being starved of Oxygen, brain damage can occur.<br /><br />This video is for personal use only, strictly non-commercial.
