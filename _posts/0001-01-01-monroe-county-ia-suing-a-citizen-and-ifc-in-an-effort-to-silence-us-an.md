{% raw %}This is a video discussion from a few of the IFC volunteers.  An explanation of how Monroe County is suing both a local individual and IFC is the focus of the discussion.  Tune in, watch, and support us.  Thank you in advance for your willingness to not only support IFC but share this information with others.  People need to know their government can and does turn on them.  This situation is horrific and needs immediate resolution.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iowafc.org/">https://iowafc.org/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ifcpac.org/">https://www.ifcpac.org/</a>{% endraw %}
