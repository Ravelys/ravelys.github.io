{% raw %}Today, BadBunny has the most important conversation we can have as people that see problems and want to fix them- what can we do right now and next week and next year to make actual progress on fixing those problems? The ensuing conversation answers that question, gives you homework, and will also probably blow your mind at least a couple times.<br />TheymerSophie's YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CurioVids">https://www.youtube.com/c/CurioVids</a><br />TheymerSophie's Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/theymersophie">https://www.twitch.tv/theymersophie</a><br /><br />Join us LIVE @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/BadBunny">https://twitch.tv/BadBunny</a><br />Every Thursday through Monday, 10AM - 5PM PT<br />&amp; Follow BadBunny on Twitter @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BadBunnyTwitch">https://twitter.com/BadBunnyTwitch</a><br /><br />Streamed on 10/28/2021 1PM PT{% endraw %}
