{% raw %}Video from the movie Stigmata by Natalie Imbruglia.<br /><br /><br />Your eyes they send me to eternity<br />Your heart may cast me down to hell<br />I'm gone but lately it's your love<br />It's condemnation enough<br /><br />Identify, please identify<br />If it's me you want standing by your side<br />Identify these tears of mine<br />Am I lonely or am I just alive?<br /><br />And let time to say<br />Who and why we stand<br />It's test of love your hands were speaking &quot;No&quot;<br />I felt the movement go<br /><br />The ice was breaking so<br />I wonder why that I'd<br />Identify with you my life<br />To leave me empty and see if I'd survive<br /><br />For every questioned hour<br />For every second devoured<br />You left me wonder you<br />Into a myth that I missed<br /><br />Identify, please identify<br />If it's me you want standing by your side<br />Identify these tears of mine<br />Am I lonely or am I just alive?<br />Am I lonely or am I just alive?{% endraw %}
