Subscribe!<br /><br />At last<br />My love has come along<br />My lonely days are over<br />And life is like a song<br />Oh yeah yeah, at last<br />The skies above are blue<br />My heart was wrapped up in clover<br />The night I looked at you<br /><br />I found a dream that I could speak to<br />A dream that I can call my own<br />I found a thrill to press my cheek to<br />A thrill that I have never known<br />Oh yeah yeah, you smiled, you smiled<br />Oh and then the spell was cast<br />And here we are in heaven<br />For you are mine<br />At Last{% endraw %}
