{% raw %}Welcome to my latest &quot;Asking 100 FPL Experts...&quot; video for the Fantasy Premier League 2021/22 season!<br /><br />I asked 100 FPL experts, podcasters, bloggers, writers and YouTubers to send me their gameweek 8 transfer plans. I recorded all of the data from all 100 teams, so I could work out a bunch of information that I could share with you. We have found out who the best players to transfer in are, who you should be transferring out, some potential bad transfers, the best captain picks and much more.<br /><br />If you like what you see, subscribe and become my latest mate!<br /><br />🐦 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/FPLMate">https://www.twitter.com/FPLMate</a><br />📸 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/FPLMate">https://www.instagram.com/FPLMate</a><br />👾 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/rfVSeftbmx">https://discord.gg/rfVSeftbmx</a><br />🏆 Join: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDAlFm2LnVcOqaFU4_AGA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDAlFm2LnVcOqaFU4_AGA/join</a><br />️⚽️ FPL Mate league link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/auto-join/b8usac">https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/auto-join/b8usac</a><br />️⚽️ FPL Mate league code: b8usac<br />👕 FPL Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fplmate.myspreadshop.co.uk/">https://fplmate.myspreadshop.co.uk/</a><br /><br />#FPL #FantasyPremierLeague #PremierLeague{% endraw %}
