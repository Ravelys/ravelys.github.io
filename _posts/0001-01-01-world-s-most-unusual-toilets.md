{% raw %}Toilets might seem like a boring topic, and the truth is they usually are. However, there are many interesting and original toilets, public bathrooms, restrooms, and urinals around the world and even up in space!<br /><br />For example, there was a fully functional 18-karat gold toilet with an interesting back story displayed at the Guggenheim Museum in NYC, then it was stolen in 2019, never to be found again.<br /><br />In Tokyo, there are transparent toilets with tinted glass walls turning opaque when the door is locked. We bet you are wondering about the unusual toilets up in space too; the International Space Station has two toilets that use a fan-driven suction system. Solid garbage is collected in individual micro-perforated bags while liquid waste is collected in containers.<br /><br />Have these unique toilets piqued your curiosity? Well, we have plenty more in our video; make sure you watch it! <br /><br />Find out more information at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/39TNwEB">https://bit.ly/39TNwEB</a> <br /><br />#engineering{% endraw %}
