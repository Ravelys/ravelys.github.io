In this short and easy lesson, I'll teach you how to use the word &quot;enough&quot; correctly based on whether the word it is modifying is a noun, an adjective, or an adverb. Once you understand this easy grammar rule, you'll never make a mistake with &quot;enough&quot; again! Just to make sure, we'll do some practice exercises together. Then you can test how well you understood the lesson with the quiz at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.engvid.com/are-you-using-enough-correctly/">https://www.engvid.com/are-you-using-enough-correctly/</a><br /><br />TRANSCRIPT<br /><br />Hi. I'm Rebecca from engVid. The word &quot;enough&quot; is a very commonly used word in English. Unfortunately, it's also a very commonly misused word. That means that many students make mistakes while using this otherwise rather simple word. The reason for that is because the word &quot;enough&quot; can be used in two different ways, and in this lesson we're going to learn exactly how to do that. Okay? Let's get started.<br /><br />So, first of all, what does the word &quot;enough&quot; mean? It means that you have as much or as many of something as you need. All right? For example, if you have just a few minutes, you have enough time to watch this lesson and to learn the lesson. Okay? Learn how to use the word &quot;enough&quot;. All right.<br /><br />So, what are these two ways in which we can use the word &quot;enough&quot;? You can either use it before a noun, or after an adjective or an adverb. Okay? Now, I know that's a lot of grammar, so let's look at some examples. So, when we use &quot;enough&quot; before a noun, we could say: &quot;We have enough food for the party.&quot;, &quot;We have enough space in this room for everyone.&quot;, &quot;We have enough chairs for all the guests.&quot; Okay? So that's an example of &quot;enough&quot; before a noun.<br /><br />Now, as I said, you can also use it after an adjective. For example: &quot;It's warm enough in the room.&quot; Okay? Or: &quot;Is your tea sweet enough?&quot;, or &quot;The teacher explained the lesson clearly enough for everyone to understand.&quot; Okay? So the last one was an adverb, the other two were adjectives.<br /><br />Now, let's take one example and use the word &quot;enough&quot; in these two different ways to see exactly how it works. First: &quot;He has enough money to buy the car.&quot; Right? So, here, before a noun. Right? &quot;He has enough money&quot;. Second example: &quot;He is rich enough to buy the car.&quot; Okay? So now we see that the &quot;enough&quot; comes after the adjective. &quot;He has enough money&quot;, &quot;He is rich enough&quot;. All right? So, that's how it works and that's all you really need to learn, but let's do some practice just to make sure that you really got it.<br /><br />So, the first word: &quot;rice&quot;. So do we say that we have &quot;enough rice&quot; or &quot;rice enough&quot;? So, &quot;rice&quot; is a noun, so we need to say: &quot;enough rice&quot;. Okay? I'm not going to write the word &quot;enough&quot;, I'll just put the &quot;e&quot; on this side or that side, according to whatever you tell me. All right. Next word: &quot;carefully&quot;. Do we say: &quot;enough carefully&quot; or &quot;carefully enough&quot;? It should be &quot;carefully enough&quot;. &quot;He drove carefully enough to pass the driving exam.&quot; Okay? All right. Do we say: &quot;enough experience&quot; or &quot;experience enough&quot;? &quot;He has enough experience.&quot; Very good. Okay.<br /><br />Do we say: &quot;enough tall&quot; or &quot;tall enough&quot;? All right? It should be: &quot;He was tall enough to reach the top shelf.&quot; Okay? Good, you're doing really well. Let's continue. Do we say: &quot;The house was enough clean&quot; or &quot;clean enough&quot;? Which one? I hope you said: &quot;The house was clean enough.&quot; Very good. Do we say: &quot;There were enough people&quot; or &quot;people enough&quot;? What do you think? &quot;There were enough people.&quot; Again, &quot;people&quot; is a noun so it's going to come before. You'll see wherever we have the e's on this side, that means those words are nouns; wherever we have the e's on that side it means those words are adjectives or adverbs. Right? This was an example of an adverb.<br /><br />Let's continue. &quot;The candidate had enough votes&quot; or &quot;The candidate had votes enough&quot;, what do you think? It should be: &quot;enough votes to win the election&quot;. Okay, good. &quot;You speak enough well to give a presentation&quot; or should we say: &quot;You speak well enough to give a presentation&quot;? What do you think? It should be &quot;well enough&quot;. All right, very good. &quot;We have enough rooms for everyone&quot; or &quot;we have rooms enough&quot;? I'm saying &quot;rooms&quot;, okay? So: &quot;We have enough rooms for everyone.&quot; Good. And: &quot;The house is enough quiet for the baby to sleep&quot; or &quot;The house is quiet enough for the baby to sleep&quot;? What do you think? Ready? Right: &quot;The house is quiet enough.&quot; Okay?<br /><br />So, as you can see, it does take a little bit of practice. Okay? But I know you can get it. I hope you got these right, but if you'd like to do some more practice, please go to our website: www.engvid.com.
