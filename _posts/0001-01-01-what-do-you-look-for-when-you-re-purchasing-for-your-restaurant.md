Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usaspiritsratings.com/en/register.php">https://usaspiritsratings.com/en/register.php</a><br /><br />In this Episode of &quot;Insights from Judges&quot;, Tamir tells us about what he thinks while purchasing for his restaurant.<br /><br />** About USA Spirits Ratings **<br /><br />The USA Spirits Ratings looks to recognise, reward and help promote spirits brands that have successfully been created to identify with and target a specific spirits drinker. For any spirits brand to earn its place on a retailerâ€™s shelf or a restaurantâ€™s spirits list -  and then vitally stay there - they need to be marketable and consumer driven and not just produced in the general hope it can find enough people willing to sell and buy it.<br /><br />That is why the USA Spirits Ratings is different. It will single out and shine the spotlight on those spirits brands that consumers really want to buy and have a clear market value for trade buyers.<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usaspiritsratings.com/">https://usaspiritsratings.com/</a><br /><br />Link to enter spirits: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usaspiritsratings.com/en/register.php">https://usaspiritsratings.com/en/register.php</a><br /><br />** About the Organizers - Beverage Trade Network **<br /><br />Beverage Trade Network is one of the world's leading networks for beverage, wine, spirits and beer importers, distributors, producers and related companies.
