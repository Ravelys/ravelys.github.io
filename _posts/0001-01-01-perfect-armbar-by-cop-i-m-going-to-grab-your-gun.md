{% raw %}Suspect is thrashing the store with a shovel when the officer arrives and takes her down. She attempts to take his gun (even telling him so), and instead of using deadly force, he applies the perfect armbar and controls her until help arrives. He remains calm the whole time, and even though higher levels of force would have been justified, his training and compassion enabled him to use the lowest level of necessary force to neutralize the threat against him. He's a legend and I can't wait to meet him. <br /><br />If anyone knows the cop, please connect him with us. He's going to get sponsored to attend the GST Instructor Certification Course, and if he can't come to one of our live certification courses, we're going to unlock the new 60-day online GST Instructor Certification Course so he can get certified without leaving his agency.
