We serve as a funnel to make sure that only the best music -- new and old -- is delivered directly to the people who care the most.<br /><br />Indie is more than a music genre. It's a sensibility. The indie fan may be overlooked in our current cultural climate, but they're alive and well -- going to see live music, visiting art galleries, and prioritizing substance over facade. This is for you.{% endraw %}
