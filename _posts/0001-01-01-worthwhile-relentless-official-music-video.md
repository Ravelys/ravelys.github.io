Old Tricks. Why can’t you speak cobblestone and bricks?<br />A tall tale told from within jail. Gold, lust, crooked politics.<br />Virtue and Vice. Men and mice. We sail to the edge to find paradise.<br />But this world can’t be flat.  I feel it.  It’s spinning out of control.<br /><br />Born and raised in a special place. Our bridge, windmills, and the naval base.<br />Sit still. Breathe in the Pacific's grace. It's home, my prison, and my escape.<br />Born and raised in a special place. It's my home, prison, my escape.<br /><br />I want to change the world, so scared to change myself.  So scared to change myself.<br />I ask for strength. Instead getting struggle every day.<br />I set my sights in to the sky then realize it’s falling on all of us.<br /><br />Too young to realize some things just can't be done.<br />Relentless. Do it anyway. Fly high. Straight at the sun.<br />That shadow of death took her father, his friend, and I can see that it wants me.<br />It will have to catch up. I’ll die chasing after my dreams.<br /><br />The old gentleman was a student to the very end.<br />Chased every thought in every book on every shelf in all the world.<br />He saw it all. War and peace, wealth and need, love and loss, pride and death.<br />And I’ll never forget what this wise man told me,<br />“The most brutal teacher of all is experience, you'll see.<br />But in return, you learn, my God do you learn.”<br /><br />I want you to see you are rich poetry.<br />An artist’s favorite, unique, messy masterpiece.<br />Magnificent songs in a genius symphony.<br />So play your role in this whole story.<br /><br />Too young to realize some things just can't be done.<br />Relentless. Do it anyway. Fly high. Straight at the sun.<br />That shadow of death took her father, his friend, and I can see that it wants me.<br />It will have to catch up. I’ll die chasing after my dreams.<br /><br />----<br />Follow Worthwhile on Twitter: @WorthwhileBand<br />Like Worthwhile on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WorthwhileBand">https://www.facebook.com/WorthwhileBand</a><br />Follow Worthwhile on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/worthwhileband">http://instagram.com/worthwhileband</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more great videos from Hopeless Records: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hopel.es/HRYouTube">http://hopel.es/HRYouTube</a><br /><br />Follow Hopeless Records on Twitter: @HopelessRecords<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://worthwhileband.com">http://worthwhileband.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.hopelessrecords.com">http://www.hopelessrecords.com</a>{% endraw %}
