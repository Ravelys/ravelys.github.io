{% raw %}It Is A Market Of Stocks Not A Stock Market<br />In this video I present 8 undervalued dividend growth stocks with dividend yields ranging from 2.51% to 5.11%.  All these companies are undervalued in what is a very overheated stock market today.  Nevertheless, as I always say it is a market of stocks and not a stock market.  Therefore, despite the high value of the overall stock market as measured by the S&amp;P 500, each of the stocks are attractively valued.  Better yet, they are all high-quality A rated or better life and health insurers with moderate levels of debt.  I offer these as extremely high-quality dividend growth stocks as prospective research candidates.  In other words, I believe there are attractively valued dividend growth stocks among this list to satisfy virtually every investorâ€™s needs whether that be current income or total return.<br /><br />Lincoln National (LNC), Aflac (AFL), Sun Life Financial (SLF), Principal Financial Group (PFG), Prudential Financial (PRU), Manulife Financial (MFC), MetLife (MET), Great West Life (GWO)<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube Channel!<br /> <br />Try FAST Graphs for FREE:<br />www.fastgraphs.com <br /><br />#dividends #stocks #investing{% endraw %}
