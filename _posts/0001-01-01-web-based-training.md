{% raw %}Letâ€™s take a look at web-based training. Computer-based training (CBT), online learning, e-learning, and web-based training refer to instruction and delivery of training by computer through the Internet or the web.<br /><br />All of these training methods can include and integrate into instruction text, interaction using simulations and games, and video, and collaboration using blogs, wikis, and social networks, and hyperlinks to additional resources.<br /><br />If online training is developed, employees need to know why it is being used, how they can use it to meet their learning needs, how to find courses, and how to gain the most benefits from them.{% endraw %}
