{% raw %}Ultra-Ever Dry - Part 2:  The sequel to the smash hit and viral sensation!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/IPM8OR6W6WE">http://youtu.be/IPM8OR6W6WE</a><br /><br />Ultra-Ever Dry is a superhydrophobic (water) and oleophobic (hydrocarbons) coating that will repel most water-based and some oil-based liquids. Ultra-Ever Dry uses proprietary omniphobic technology to coat an object and create a surface chemistry and texture with patterns of geometric shapes that have &quot;peaks&quot; or &quot;high points&quot;.  These high points repel water, some oils, wet concrete, and other liquids unlike any other coating.<br /> <br />Ultra-Ever Dry has vastly improved adhesion and abrasion resistance, compared to previous superhydrophobic technologies, allowing it to be used in applications where greater durability is required.
