{% raw %}Finally, a bedroom for teeny mini Ariel, with a bath close by as she really wouldn't want to dry out. But I'm not finished yet......make sure you check back in, Ariel's bedroom has hidden depths that we haven't yet explored......ðŸ˜‰.  <br /><br />Hi! If you've just dropped by, I'm Ellie! Stick around and I'll build for you while I review new sets. I tend to geek out about new pieces, interesting building techniques, giggle too much and just generally ramble. I'm easily distracted so I get stuff wrong which I fix up, mostly, but in the end there is always an awesome model ready for play and display. Huzzah for Lego, the building and creating tool for anybody, no matter what age you are!<br /><br />And don't forget that you can also get a cool ellieV toys t-shirt and other stuff from here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch</a><br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/mPFBb1">https://goo.gl/mPFBb1</a><br /><br />Lots more ellieV toys videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/CXhf59">https://goo.gl/CXhf59</a><br />Sylvanian Families / Calico Critters videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr">http://bit.ly/1LpJvDr</a><br />Lego Friends videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xbV84E">https://goo.gl/xbV84E</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and like if you enjoy - I appreciate every single one of your views!<br /><br />Music - Winner Winner<br />Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) <br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
