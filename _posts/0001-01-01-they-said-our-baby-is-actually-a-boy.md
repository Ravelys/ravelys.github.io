Family Fun Pack is my family of 8 who love to travel and live life to the fullest. With new videos of our daily adventures and milestones posted regularly, you are sure be entertained on our channel.  I offer parenting advice each Monday in my Mommy Monday vlog. I also share my parenting style along the way in my other vlogs, but I like to do it in a more subtle way that comes across as I vlog my daily life.  Our videos are authentic family fun. Thanks for following my journey though parenthood as a mom!<br /><br />Want to send fan mail?

We made this video simply for entertainment.<br />#familyfunpack #genderreveal #bumpdate{% endraw %}
