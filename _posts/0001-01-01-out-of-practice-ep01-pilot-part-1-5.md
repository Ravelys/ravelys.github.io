Stewart, Ben's father also stirs things up by bringing his young new girlfriend to the family affair.<br /><br /><br /><br />A brilliant, intelligent, wonderful television comedy series that originally aired on CBS in 2005. Starring Paula Marshall, Stockard Channing, Henry Winkler, Christopher Gorham, Ty Burrell, and Jennifer Tilly. With Emmy Award-winning producers Joe Keenan and Christopher Lloyd (&quot;Frasier&quot;). I believe it is one of the best comedy series this decade. I have not watched the CBS network since they cancelled the show. t is Ben Barnes' 30th birthday and all his family is present when he learns that his wife wants to leave him.
