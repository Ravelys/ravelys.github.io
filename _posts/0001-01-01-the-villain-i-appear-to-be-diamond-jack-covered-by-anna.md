{% raw %}Hello everyone! This week I sang The Villain I Appear To Be from Diamond Jack, composed by Connor Spiotto! <br /><br />I love Diamond Jack! If you haven’t had the chance to see it, it’s student animation by Rachel Kim. It’s so fREAKING COOL! The animation with the combination of the vocals and music is just so perfect. I feel so incredibly lucky to even have the chance to cover this song!  If you want to check it out, here’s the link! [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRpiBvwKX6c]">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRpiBvwKX6c]</a> <br /><br />I haven’t sung anything super jazzy in the past little while but MAN did I ever need it. I love a good upbeat swing. There's always so much freedom to have fun in jazz arrangements. I really enjoyed recording this one! Connor Spiotto is a god.<br /><br />As always, thank you all so much for your continued love and support! I hope you have a fantastic week and I’ll see you all Saturday.<br />♥<br /><br />✦✦CREDITS✦✦<br />The Villain I Appear To Be - Diamond Jack<br />Composer - Conor Spiotto [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/connorspiotto]">https://soundcloud.com/connorspiotto]</a><br />Original Vocals - Molly Pease [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mollypeasemusic.com/]">https://www.mollypeasemusic.com/]</a><br />Diamond Jack - created by Rachel Kim [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ8nwSuoQiIBh-M3bv7b8gA]">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ8nwSuoQiIBh-M3bv7b8gA]</a><br />Artwork: ttoba  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ttoba.tumblr.com/">https://ttoba.tumblr.com/</a> + @ttobeeb] <br />(a superstar artist u should totally check out!) <br />Instrumental - Connor Spiotto (official instrumental!)<br />[<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://connorspiotto.bandcamp.com/track/the-villain-i-appear-to-be-instrumental]">https://connorspiotto.bandcamp.com/track/the-villain-i-appear-to-be-instrumental]</a><br />Vocals: Anna - that’s me! <br />I only own my voice!
