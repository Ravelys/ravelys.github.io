{% raw %}It's been over a decade since Scarface: The World Is Yours blessed some of us with its presence. Ever since then, some people have been clamouring for the sequel that never came. Scarface is a game that rivaled GTA in many areas and takes its place in my book as one of the best open world games of all time. I've been wanting this to make a return one way or another and that is what I talk about in this video. I go through what The World Is Yours is, what happened to it, where are we with a sequel or even a remaster and just discuss why this is a very good game.<br /><br />Side note,<br /><br />There was also a PSP Scarface game I don't really have many thoughts on. It wasn't great. Also, Hollywood is making yet another unnecessary product as a Scarface remake is set to hit us in 2018. You don't make a remake of something that's still great today! Even though 1983 Scarface is a remake of 1932 Scarface, that's different.<br /><br />Timestamp: 18:25<br /><br />Willzyyy's Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Willzyyy">https://www.youtube.com/user/Willzyyy</a><br /><br />Sources:<br />- Scarface: The World is Yours: Making the Game (Documentary).<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/8/13857230/vivendi-ubisoft-stock-takeover">https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/8/13857230/vivendi-ubisoft-stock-takeover</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/07/12/scarface-hands-on-4">http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/07/12/scarface-hands-on-4</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/08/10/scarface-game-announced">http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/08/10/scarface-game-announced</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/gdc-2005-scarface-first-look">http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/gdc-2005-scarface-first-look</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scarface-the-world-is-yours-exclusive-hands-on/1100-6146759/">https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scarface-the-world-is-yours-exclusive-hands-on/1100-6146759/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/i_scarface">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/i_scarface</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/03/02/official-scarface-announced-for-wii">http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/03/02/official-scarface-announced-for-wii</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/06/scarface-and-50-cent-sequels-planned">http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/06/scarface-and-50-cent-sequels-planned</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/13/activision-blizzard-vivendi-buyout/">https://www.engadget.com/2013/10/13/activision-blizzard-vivendi-buyout/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/activision-blizzard-kills-off-scarface-2/014862">http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/activision-blizzard-kills-off-scarface-2/014862</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/vivendi-to-acquire-control-of-activision/">https://www.cnet.com/news/vivendi-to-acquire-control-of-activision/</a><br /><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/redbeakraven">https://twitter.com/redbeakraven</a> <br />My Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RedBeakRaven-1574547699518262/">https://www.facebook.com/RedBeakRaven-1574547699518262/</a> <br /><br />Background track - &quot;Bet On It&quot; by Silent Partner{% endraw %}
