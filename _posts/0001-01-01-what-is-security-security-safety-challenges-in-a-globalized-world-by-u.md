Challenges such as, cyber-crime, terrorism, and environmental disasters impact the lives of millions across the globe. These issues also rank high on the agenda of politicians, international organizations and businesses. They also feature prominently in the public conscience and in governmental policies. <br /><br />In the current, interconnected world, security challenges are becoming increasingly complex. Facilitated by developments as globalization and the spread of networked and hyper-connected technologies, new safety and security challenges arise and impact local, national, regional and international levels, which dramatically increases their complexity and scale. As such, solutions to contemporary security challenges require a wide array of actors operating on multiple levels of governance.<br /><br />The course will introduce you to the broad theme of security and safety in an increasingly complex world. Together we will search for answers to important questions: what is security and safety? How can we understand complex modern-day security and safety challenges?  And how do we deal with such challenges?  This course combines scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from terrorism studies, to crisis management, to medical science) with real-life cases to explore and understand complex modern-day safety and security challenges.<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/security-safety-globalized-world?utm_source=yt&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=channel&amp;utm_content=leiden">https://www.coursera.org/learn/security-safety-globalized-world?utm_source=yt&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=channel&amp;utm_content=leiden</a> to learn more!<br /><br />Keep in touch with Coursera!<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/coursera">https://twitter.com/coursera</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Coursera/">https://www.facebook.com/Coursera/</a>{% endraw %}
