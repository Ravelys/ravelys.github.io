{% raw %}Hello all. I am posting this interesting problem from International Math Olympiad (IMO) about how to solve the system of equations through manipulation. Can you solve this system of equations? International Math Olympiad (IMO) is full of challenging yet interesting problems that I am planning to cover many of them. I want all of you to pause the video for a while and solve this problem first before watching the video until the end. More to come! Stay tuned!<br /><br />#IMO #internationalmatholympiad #systemofequations{% endraw %}
