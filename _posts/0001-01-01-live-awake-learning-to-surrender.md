{% raw %}Surrender means to give up, abandon, relinquish, to wave the white flag. What a beautifully divine word. A word we should choose at every chance we can remember, for as the story goes, we are not in control, we are floating on a cosmic river carried from the stars, into our mothers womb, out into the world, where we then resume the same course, only now grounded in body.<br />This episode helps let go of our worries and fears. It reminds us that we are supported and that life is unfolding just as it should.{% endraw %}
