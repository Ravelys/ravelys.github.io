By continuing to click, you create a path made of straight line segments connected by corner points.<br /><br />▶ In Adobe Illustrator using the Pen tool you create a curve by adding an anchor point where a curve changes direction, and dragging the direction lines that shape the curve. The length and slope of the direction lines determine the shape of the curve.<br /><br /><br />More from Elias Sarantopoulos ❤<br />Creative tutorials from Elias Sarantopoulos.
