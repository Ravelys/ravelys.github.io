{% raw %}This week, Lilly’s joined by Beth Birch from the Washing Machine Project, a project aiming to alleviate the burdens associated with hand washing. <br /><br />Hand washing is done by around 5 billion people across the globe and can take up to 20 hours per week, using around 40 litres of water per wash and associated with health risks. The Washing Machine Project’s ‘Divya’ is a portable, manual, off-grid washing machine providing a practical solution to these burdens.<br /><br />To find out more about The Washing Machine Project and how you can get involved or support their work, check out their website here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thewashingmachineproject.org/">https://www.thewashingmachineproject.org/</a><br /><br />Donate to their fundraiser for the ‘Divya 2’ here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/.../the-washing-machine-project">https://www.justgiving.com/.../the-washing-machine-project</a><br /><br />For more eco-news on the solutions to climate change, don’t forget to subscribe!<br /><br />FIND US ON:<br /><br />Twitter: @risingearthnews<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RisingEarthN...​">https://www.facebook.com/RisingEarthN...​</a><br />Website: www.rising.earth{% endraw %}
