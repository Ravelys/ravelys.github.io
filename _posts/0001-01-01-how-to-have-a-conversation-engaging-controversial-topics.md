{% raw %}You're in a conversation with a coworker and they're pretty vocal about a controversial topic. You want to say something, but you're having a hard time gathering the confidence to respond. <br /><br />What would you say? <br /><br />Questions are a risk-free way to engage in a conversation, giving you latitude, liberty and effectiveness, without assuming too much responsibility. They can be used to engage a close friend or a complete stranger. The next time you're in a conversation and don't know how to proceed. Here are three things to remember:<br /><br />First, don't immediately try to answer the challenge or run from it. <br />Second, gather Intel about the challenge. <br />Third, always ask for clarification with some form of this question: “What do you mean by that?”<br /><br />Thanks to Greg Koukl for his contributions to this video.
