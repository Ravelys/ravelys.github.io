Still been spending all our paychecks at the liquor store.  Plastic between your teeth before we reach the door.  But you show up to my room with an arm full of booze God you’re perfect.  So, you can say what you like, say I’m wasting my life, say I’m worthless.  I probably deserve it.  Pheremones have brought us back together for another hit.  Your horoscopes and astrology is all a load of shit.  But, I’ve been watching your cues and I know all the right moves to get you ornery.  So, meet me in the bathroom and I’ll do what I do to get you ornery.  You’ve been spending all my time and you don’t even know me.  We’re always getting fucked up, why do you really need to know me?  The roaches in my bathtub sigh and roll their eyes with your groaning.  I’ve been wasting all my time.  I’ve been wasting all my time.<br /><br />Join us on our networks!<br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sideonedummy.com">http://www.sideonedummy.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/sideonedummy">http://www.facebook.com/sideonedummy</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/sideonedummy">http://www.twitter.com/sideonedummy</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/sideonedummy">http://www.instagram.com/sideonedummy</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/sideonedummy">https://open.spotify.com/user/sideonedummy</a><br /><br />#mcrwv #microwaveatl #microwavetheband{% endraw %}
