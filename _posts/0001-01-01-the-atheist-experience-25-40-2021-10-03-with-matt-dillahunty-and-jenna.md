Welcome back to the co-host chair Jenna!<br /><br />First up is Mohammad from NE, who defines god as any conscious entity that is capable of influencing celestial objects beyond our (modern humans) comprehension. Nothing presented by the caller contains anything relevant to a scientific argument.<br /><br />Next up is Tommy from IL who wants to know if our hosts are still searching for an answer to a God question, or if they have gotten to where they have reached a point of certainty in their current position.<br /><br />Robin from DC is calling in to tell us about some slick new labels for Atheism: Local &amp; Global. Local Atheism refers to someone who doesn’t believe that a subset of Gods exist, but accepts others. Unfortunately, Robin asserts the only way that a person can determine whether one subset exists and the other doesn’t is through God’s revelation.<br /><br />Up next is DJ from CO who is worried about leaving their child under the care of a religious family member. Exposure to new, different ideas, will likely help in the long run with the child’s development of critical thinking skills. However, making the violation of trust clear to the family members is important if you want to maintain a healthy relationship with them in the future.<br /><br />Next up is Nikki from CA who believes that they have made contact with a deceased family member. The caller had requested prior to their death that they give her a sign that they are alright, and a year later she receives a notification that his social media account liked her photo. How do we know that this was anything more than a bug in the app?<br />Call the show on Sundays 4:30pm-6:00pm CT: 1-512-686-0279 or use your computer to save on long-distance charges: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiny.cc/calltheshow">http://tiny.cc/calltheshow</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► Don't like commercials?
