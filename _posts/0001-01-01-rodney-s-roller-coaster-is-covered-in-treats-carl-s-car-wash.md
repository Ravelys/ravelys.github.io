But when the kids bring their carnival candies with them on the ride, the roller-coaster gets covered in treats! Rodney will have to roll his coaster on over to Carl’s Car Wash! With a quick mess assessment and a few twists of some knobs, Carl’s suds-sational car wash is ready to give Rodney’s vehicle a good scrub-a-dub! Rodney leaves one happy customer, and is ready to head back to the carnival!<br /><br />PARENTS AND TEACHERS: Thank you so much for watching Super Simple Songs with your families and/or students.
