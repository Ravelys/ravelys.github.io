{% raw %}Sarah Dean<br />UC Berkeley<br /><br />February 21, 2020<br />Machine learning provides a promising path to distill information from high dimensional sensors like cameras -- a fact that often serves as motivation for merging learning with control. This talk aims to provide rigorous guarantees for systems with such learned perception components in closed-loop. Our approach is comprised of characterizing uncertainty in perception and then designing a robust controller to account for these errors. We use a framework which handles uncertainties in an explicit way, allowing us to provide performance guarantees and illustrate how trade-offs arise from limitations of the training data. Throughout, I will motivate this work with the example of autonomous vehicles, including both simulated experiments and an implementation on a 1/10 scale autonomous car. Joint work with Aurelia Guy, Nikolai Matni, Ben Recht, Rohan Sinha, and Vickie Ye.<br /><br />View the full playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMeercb-kvGLUrOq4HR6BZD</a>{% endraw %}
