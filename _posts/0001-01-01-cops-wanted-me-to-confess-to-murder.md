{% raw %}At 23, Sean Crane was sentenced to 7 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.<br />With nothing positive to show for his life up to that point and a massive challenge ahead he had a decision to make. <br />Would he give up and let the rest of his life pass him by like the first 23 did or could he face his fears, fight through the pain and pursue the life he always wanted..<br />From a small cement box Sean was able to take control of his life.<br />He completely transformed his mentality, his routines, and the results he got in his life. <br />“ In that cell I started to create the life of my dreams that I am able to live today.”<br />Sean Michael Crane is a Life Coach, Speaker and Best Selling Author with an incredible story of perseverance and determination.
