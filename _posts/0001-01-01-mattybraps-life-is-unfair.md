Lately she… she just been trippin’ <br />School Councilor: Why is she tripping, Matthew?<br />MattyB:  Because. She doesn’t understand me.  I’m a teenager now.  Like, she’s not cool.<br />School Councilor: Why don’t you tell me about it?<br /> <br />Verse 1<br />Man, she got my head in a spiral<br />Cause I done made a new wave<br />I done hit the front page and I just went viral<br />Because my flows like tidal<br />But I don’t think my own mama understands, legit<br />How my beats kick, kick harder than jackie chan<br />And my hits stay lit for my fans in japan<br />All the way from the Chattahoochee to California sands<br />And i flow magnificent-ly<br />Cause i was born to the different - see<br />I get the… world in a tizzy<br />Got my generation with me<br />The wiz kid’s been busy<br />I spit till i get dizzy<br />I try to stay focused, but I put the jokers on notice<br />It’s me….<br />As you can tell on this mic I’m for real<br />I said, “Ma, at the studio late”<br />Her reply?  No problem, but curfew at eight!”<br /><br />Chorus<br />It doesn’t matter what I do<br />Could have the song of the year<br />There’s one thing I always deal with<br />It’s become crystal clear<br />I wanna be a famous rapper but my mom doesn’t care<br />She’ll always treat me like her baby so my life is unfair<br />Check it out man<br /><br />That’s why my life is unfair<br />I wanna be a famous rapper but my mom doesn’t care<br />It doesn’t matter what I do, could have the song of the year<br />She’ll always treat me like her baby so my life is unfair<br /><br />Verse 2<br />You know what else?  man, I just got some red bottoms! (fuego!)<br />And my momma made me mow the lawn the same day that I got ‘em<br />How am I supposed to hit the gram and be cool<br />When I got this big green grass stain on my shoe ma<br />Then I got a new watch, you know the kind<br />It don’t tick like yours, it just slide<br />Left the jewelry store, made it home and dinner was delicious<br />Put my plate in the sink and mama told me to do the dishes<br />Now I’m standing at the sink tryna think<br />Wow… if I lose a diamond I’mma freak… out<br />Listening to music as a I scrub a dub dub<br />Feeling like a idiot from wearing yellow rubber gloves<br />And I finally get off all the grease <br />I got my phone blowing up from a girl that’s a dime piece <br />I said, “Mom, we’re just friends… I won’t kiss her”<br />She said, “I don’t if you go but you’re taking your baby sister”<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Bridge<br /><br />School Councilor:  Would you like to know what I think, Matthew?<br />MattyB:  What’s up?<br />School Councilor:  Well, It sounds to me like you have a mother that loves you very much, and I think I know what you should do.<br />MattyB:  You do?<br />School Councilor: Yes.  Why don’t you call her and let her know that we’re wrapping up.  I just got a text from her.<br />MattyB:  Are you serious?<br />School Councilor:  Well you’re going to be late to your orthodontist appointment, mister!<br />MattyB:  This is literally what I’m talk about.  I’m out.<br /><br />Chorus{% endraw %}
