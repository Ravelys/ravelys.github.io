One example is car brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi ‚Äì they show different categories. Another instance is answers to yes and no questions. If we ask questions like:<br />-Are you currently enrolled in a university? <br />Or<br />-Do you own a car? <br />Yes and no would be the two groups of answers that can be obtained.<br />This is categorical data. <br /><br />On the other hand, numerical data, as its name suggests, represents numbers. It is further divided into two subsets: discrete and continuous. <br />Discrete data can usually be counted in a finite matter. A good example would be the number of children that you want to have. Even if you don‚Äôt know exactly how many, you are absolutely sure that the value will be an integer such as 0, 1, 2, or even 10.<br /><br />Continuous data is infinite and impossible to count. For instance, your weight can take on every value in some range!<br /><br />‚ñ∫ Consider hitting the SUBSCRIBE button if you LIKE the content: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/365DataScience?sub_confirmation=1</a>  <br /><br />‚ñ∫ VISIT our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/365ds">https://bit.ly/365ds</a>  <br /><br />ü§ù Connect with us LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/365datascience/</a>  <br /><br />365 Data Science is an online educational career website that offers the incredible opportunity to find your way into the data science world no matter your previous knowledge and experience.
