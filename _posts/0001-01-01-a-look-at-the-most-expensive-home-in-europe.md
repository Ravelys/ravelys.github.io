{% raw %}Welcome to Villa Leopolda-- the most expensive private home in Europe and the third most expensive residence in the world! Worth an estimated $750 million, the French villa has quite the history-- it’s been a King’s gift to his mistress, a military hospital, the personal estate of a widowed billionaire, and it’s so expensive that a Russian billionaire tried to back out of buying it at the last minute. <br /><br />You can immediately see Villa Leopolda’s history by heading inside and taking in all the art, historic architecture and vintage furniture. The house as it stands today was designed by American architect Ogden Codman, Jr., who’s responsible for adding the mansion’s gorgeous pool. The estate, also known as La Leopolda, was designed with everything to meet a billionaire’s needs-- there’s a bowling alley, movie theater, sports court, spacious garage, and even a helipad. <br /><br />The most recent owner of the home is Lily Safra, though billionaire Bill Gates has also been a rumoured buyer. However, the home’s most famous resident is also who it’s named after. King Leopold II of Belgium was the one who first bought the land where the historic villa sits and turned it into a lavish vacation home where he could get away from his wife. <br /><br />From royals to billionaires, Villa Leopolda has surely seen it all. The waterfront estate is packed with luxurious amenities and perfectly manicured grounds. So, let’s head to the French Riviera and discover what makes La Leopolda one of the world’s most impressive homes! <br /><br />Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest</a> ◄<br /><br />Written by: Courtney Hayes <br />Narrated by: Adam Newmark<br />Edited by: M.A<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:43 Touring Villa Leopolda’s royal interior <br />03:10 It’s situated on 50 acres with sprawling gardens <br />04:42 It’s been home to kings and billionaires{% endraw %}
