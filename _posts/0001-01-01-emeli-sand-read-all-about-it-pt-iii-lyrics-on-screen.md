{% raw %}You've got the words to change a nation<br />But you're biting your tongue<br />You've spent a life time stuck in silence<br />Afraid you'll say something wrong<br />If no one ever hears it how we gonna learn your song?<br />So come, on come on<br />Come on, come on<br />You've got a heart as loud as lions<br />So why let your voice be tamed?<br />Baby we're a little different<br />There's no need to be ashamed<br />You've got the light to fight the shadows<br />So stop hiding it away<br />Come on, Come on<br /><br />I wanna sing, I wanna shout<br />I wanna scream till the words dry out<br />So put it in all of the papers,<br />I'm not afraid<br />They can read all about it<br />Read all about it oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br /><br />At night we're waking up the neighbours<br />While we sing away the blues<br />Making sure that we remember yeah<br />Cause we all matter too<br />If the truth has been forbidden<br />Then we're breaking all the rules<br />So come on, come on<br />Come on, come on,<br />Let's get the tv and the radio<br />To play our tune again<br />It's 'bout time we got some airplay of our version of events<br />There's no need to be afraid<br />I will sing with you my friend<br />Come on, come on<br /><br />I wanna sing, I wanna shout<br />I wanna scream till the words dry out<br />So put it in all of the papers,<br />I'm not afraid<br />They can read all about it<br />Read all about it oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br /><br />Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people<br />So when did we all get so fearful?<br />Now we're finally finding our voices<br />So take a chance, come help me sing this<br />Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people<br />So when did we all get so fearful?<br />And now we're finally finding our voices<br />So take a chance, come help me sing this<br /><br />I wanna sing, I wanna shout<br />I wanna scream till the words dry out<br />So put it in all of the papers,<br />I'm not afraid<br />They can read all about it<br />Read all about it oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br />Oh-oh-oh<br /><br />I wanna sing, I wanna shout<br />I wanna scream till the words dry out<br />So put it in all of the papers,<br />I'm not afraid<br />They can read all about it<br />Read all about it oh{% endraw %}
