{% raw %}I recommend watching this video first for more of an explanation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/k_FP9SlCYq8">https://youtu.be/k_FP9SlCYq8</a><br />BRO MY MOTIVATION MAKING THIS THOUGH- OML I TOOK SO MANY BREAKSSS. I also started reading something on Wattpad but couldn't continue it because I needed this done. 💔<br /><br />More of an explanation of the whole &quot;no sign language&quot; thing: In my AU the some of teachers are roughly fluent in sign language (All Might, Nezu, Vlad King and Present Mic as for now), they can make some mistakes there and there. But the reason why Nezu doesn't want the teens to use it is because of possible traitor discussing (like the traitors discussing attacks and shit), teachers are informed whether a student is deaf or not and that's the only time you can uses sign language, if a student is deaf and can't afford/doesn't have hearing aids. Nezu wants to minimize the risk of talking about attacks on UA/possibly accusing someone of being the traitor. He knows he can't really stop the talk at all, but if some teachers haven't learnt enough sign language yet then in the classroom sign language can not be used. For example if Aizawa was teaching like he was in the video, the class couldn't use sign language because he wouldn't understand everything. However if Mic was teaching the class, they would be able to use sign language since he understands and will be able to point out if any traitor discussion is going on.<br /><br />·̩̩̥＊•̩̩͙✩•̩̩͙˚ <br /><br />Subscriber Count: 33,708<br /><br />·̩̩̥＊•̩̩͙✩•̩̩͙˚ <br /><br />ʚ-┊・Socials<br /><br />•🍰• Discord: okeymxnt 2174 - hashtag<br /><br />•🌻• Instagram: @okeymxnt<br /><br />•🌼• Twitter: @okeymxnt<br /><br />•🌱• TikTok: @okeymxnt <br /><br />•🌹• Twitch: @okeymxnt <br /><br />•🍒• Casting Call Club: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.castingcall.club/m/okeymxnt">https://www.castingcall.club/m/okeymxnt</a><br /><br />·̩̩̥＊•̩̩͙✩•̩̩͙˚ <br /><br />ʚ-┊・Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/G5V5GzmnF3">https://discord.gg/G5V5GzmnF3</a><br /><br />·̩̩̥＊•̩̩͙✩•̩̩͙˚ <br /><br />ʚ-┊・Information<br /><br />•🍡• Time taken: 6 hours<br /><br />•🍥• Laziness: 50%<br /><br />•🍬• Apps used: Gacha Club, KineMaster, iBisPaint X<br /><br />•🧁• Original Audio: ?<br /><br />⊱─ෆ━━━━━━━━━ෆ─⊰<br /><br />Love you all, have a great day!  💕💕{% endraw %}
