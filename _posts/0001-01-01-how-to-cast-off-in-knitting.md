{% raw %}Today I shall be showing you how to cast off in knitting. Simply start with the stitch you would normally work, such as a purl or knit stitch and when you have two loops on your right needle, pull the first loop over the second and drop. Keep going until you have one loop left. Cut your yarn and pull through to finish!<br /><br />I am so excited to get started in teaching you how to knit, starting at the very basics and moving on to more advanced stitches and projects as time goes on.<br /><br />If you don't know me already, I am best known for my crochet tutorials and you can find my crochet channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/happyberrycrochet">http://www.youtube.com/happyberrycrochet</a>{% endraw %}
