{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks about the latest in a line of Biden gaffes, Mark Zuckerberg’s fiery response to the accusations of the Facebook whistleblower, and Canada announcing it’s absurd Thanksgiving restrictions. First, Dave shares a clip of Joe Biden’s speech at the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 324 training facility in Howell, Michigan. In what feels like the millionth piece of evidence of cognitive decline, Biden can’t remember the words he’s trying to use. Dave does his best to decipher his message. Next, Mark Zuckerberg goes on the attack against Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. Dave discusses Mark’s statement as well as new information about Frances Haugen that makes her motives quite suspect. Is she a truth teller or a progressive activist trying to get the government to censor speech on Facebook? Finally, in Canadian news the Premier of Alberta Jason Kenney announced new coronavirus restrictions for the Thanksgiving holiday. While he does not plan to cancel Thanksgiving he might as well with his insane restrictions. Dave gives his reaction to these absurd rules.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Today’s Sponsors:<br />Raycon - Looking for new wireless earbuds starting at half the price of other premium brands?<br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.buyraycon.com/rubin">http://www.buyraycon.com/rubin</a><br />Rubin Report viewers will get 15% off all their products.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Watch The Rubin Report on BlazeTV:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.blazetv.com/series/8oHZJGqX8aaN-the-rubin-report">https://www.blazetv.com/series/8oHZJGqX8aaN-the-rubin-report</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />The Direct Message segments of the Rubin Report are a chance for Dave Rubin to directly address current events, political news and the topics of the day.
