{% raw %}An Inexpensive, Great Shave -  The Merkur 34G &amp; Proraso Green Soap is this week's video on Friendship Shaving. It really was a fantastic shave. The Merkur 34G paired up beautifully with a Feather razor blade. <br /><br />Proraso soap was one of my 'starter' soaps. With a full range of products to suit all skin types, it remains one of my favourite brands. I enjoyed the Green, Eucalyptus and Menthol version.<br /><br />With thanks to:<br />Steve Dalton üëç.<br /><br />If you would like to help Friendship Shaving keep up to date, with the newest shaving items; have more give-aways; help with postage and customs fees, etc. You can do so here:<br />paypal.me/friendshipshaving<br /><br />Please subscribe: it will really help me out.
