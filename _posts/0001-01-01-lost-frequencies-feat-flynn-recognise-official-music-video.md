Merging with Lost Frequencies’ tropical take on self-proclaimed “indie-dance”, the work of the two artists together on this collaboration transcends genres, fusing together brooding pop, introspective lyrics and native woodwind and studio-driven percussion for a brooding pop hit.<br /><br />Music video by Soulvizion <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soulvizion.com">http://soulvizion.com</a> <br />Special thanks to: Yetunde &amp; The Vintage Alternatives - Inu4vintage and Wisseloord Studios<br /><br />Follow Lost Frequencies on<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LostFrequenc...">https://www.facebook.com/LostFrequenc...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lostfrequen...">https://www.instagram.com/lostfrequen...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LFrequencies">https://twitter.com/LFrequencies</a><br /><br />Follow Flynn on:<br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/darrenf921">https://www.youtube.com/user/darrenf921</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iamflynn/?h...">https://www.instagram.com/iamflynn/?h...</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/IamFLYNNmusic/">https://en-gb.facebook.com/IamFLYNNmusic/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/iamflynnmusic?lang=en">https://twitter.com/iamflynnmusic?lang=en</a><br /><br />#LostFrequencies #FoundFrequencies #Flynn #Recognise{% endraw %}
