{% raw %}first video from a series of my Hiking Videos in the Negev desert.<br /><br />During my work in geological mapping, sometimes there is no enough time to  take a good and beautiful picture, and sometimes the picture does not convey the power of the landscape.<br /> in this video I decided to document the desert, and my hiking through the desert landscape, in a way that conveys the power of the desert in a more touching way than just a photo.<br /><br />At the end of the video you can see some landscape photos I took during the hike, and a location map of the trail.<br /><br /><br />if you have any question let me know.<br /><br />and please share and subscribe <br /><br /><br />equipment I use:<br />• Nikon Z6 <br />• Nikkor Z - 14-30 mm f/4 s<br />• Nikkor F - 24 -125 mm f/4<br />• HOYA 82mm CIR-PL HD Nano<br />• Rode pro plus <br />• Tripod benro a155fbr<br />• Galaxss8<br />• Gopro hero 6<br /><br />Music licensed by epidemic sound <br />- 00:01 Thoughts about the Past - Elm Lake<br />- 02:47 The Sleep - Joseph Beg<br />- 09:00 Moving Silence - Spirits Of Our Dreams<br />- 11:15 Threads - Ebb &amp; Flod{% endraw %}
