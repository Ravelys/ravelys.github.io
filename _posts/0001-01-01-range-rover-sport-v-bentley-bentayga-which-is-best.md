{% raw %}Need help buying your next car? Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow">http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />In the market for a posh, luxury SUV that’s also a bit sporty? Then this video is just what you need… <br /><br />Mat’s got his hands on both the Bentley Bentayga Hybrid &amp; the Range Rover Sport PHEV and they’re going head-to-head over a series of tests to see which is the must-have luxury (but sporty) SUV. <br /><br />Starting off with the Bentley, it’s powered by a 3-litre turbocharged V6 along with an electric motor to deliver 449hp &amp; 700Nm of torque. It also includes a 17kWh battery pack which is good for 25 miles of electric driving range, and as you’d expect, it comes with an absolutely gorgeous interior! It’ll set you back a fair bit though, with prices starting from £155,000. <br /><br />Next up we have the Range Rover Sport. The size of the motor is down compared to the Bentley, with a 2-litre 4 cylinder hiding under the bonnet. However, it’ll still deliver a more than sizeable 404hp &amp; 640Nm. And while it has a smaller battery pack compared to the Bentayga (at 13kWh), it’ll still provide you with 25 miles of electric-only driving range. <br /><br />The Range Rover Sport has one BIG advantage over the Bentley though… It’ll cost you half the price, at just £75,000! So is the Bentley really twice as good as the Range Rover? You’ll need to keep watching to find out!<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:55 Engines<br />01:44 Town Driving<br />04:28 Charging &amp; Batteries<br />05:18 Brakes &amp; Brake Test<br />06:33 Exterior Design<br />08:31 Interior<br />11:03 Motorway Driving<br />12:34 Back Seats<br />14:22 Twisty Road Driving<br />16:21 Boot<br />17:18 0-60mph<br />18:14 Verdict<br /><br />Range Rover review - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Range-Rover-Review-2021">https://bit.ly/Range-Rover-Review-2021</a><br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
