The reason I am out here this morning is because today's topic is all about SHOPPING. What you like and don' t like about shopping. We are going to be looking at useful language, vocabulary  and expressions you might need to talk confidently on that subject. <br /><br />*****<br /><br />This Lesson:<br /><br />00:00:00 Welcome <br />00:01:22 Lesson Plan <br />00:05:18 Where to Download Free PDF<br />00:07:15 Essential Vocabulary<br />00:23:10 Guest - Conversation with Eli <br />00:53:40 QUESTION: Do you prefer online or offline shopping?<br />01:00:08 QUESTION: Describe something you bought and felt happy with <br />01:06:30 Idioms about Shopping<br />01:14:44  Sample Answers  <br />01:17:20 What are the differences between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs shopping habits?<br />01:19:53 What is the product which is consumed most in your country?
