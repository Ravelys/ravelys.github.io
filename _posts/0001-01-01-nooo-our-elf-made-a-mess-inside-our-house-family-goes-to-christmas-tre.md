{% raw %}and a Spacestation trophy parade around the office! lol<br /><br />JOIN OUR FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Elf Day Ever 1055<br /><br />Welcome to 6:30 in the morning at the Shonduras house! Adley got both Jenny and I up to see what our elf on a shelf did last night. We head down stairs and almost instantly Adley sees the elf. She’s laying in a pile of snow and it looks like she made snow angels! There is also a string that Adley and I have to follow in order to find the present that she left for Adley. Adley must have been a really good girl yesterday because she got an awesome gift this morning! <br /><br />We then continue our normal routine until we realize that Adley doesn’t need to get ready because they are having pajama day at her school! She also has some gifts and treats she’s taking with her and she’s super excited to we jump in the car and I drop her off on my way to the Spacestation. So crazy to think about how grown up Adley, she started off as the best baby ever now she’s going to school in her PJ’s!!<br /><br />At the spacestation, i give you guys some updates from the office. Renovations that have been happening, Getting the trophy from a Spacestation Gaming win, and just keeping you guys in the loop! It’s been a minute since we’ve updated you all on what's been going on. <br /><br />After work, it’s time for a family first, something that Niko Bear and Adley have never done. But it’s a surprise!! (Hint: it has to do with Christmas and lights!)<br /><br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video: ADLEY EATS A MiNiON!!
