{% raw %}Atheists often respond to the cosmic fine-tuning argument by appealing to the multiverse. If our universe is one of a vast (possibly infinite) array of universes, perhaps a life-permitting universe isn't so improbable after all. But if atheists can appeal to the multiverse to answer cosmic fine-tuning, can't theists appeal to the multiverse to answer the problem of evil?<br /><br />William Lane Craig's Reasonable Faith animated video on the fine-tuning of the universe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE76nwimuT0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE76nwimuT0</a><br /><br />#Multiverse #ProblemOfEvil #DavidWood{% endraw %}
