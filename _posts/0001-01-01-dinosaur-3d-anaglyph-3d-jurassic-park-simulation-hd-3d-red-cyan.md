{% raw %}I created a 3D ANAGLYPH video based on the game &quot;Crytek Back to Dinosaur Island&quot; by using the latest 3D software technology Cyberlink PowerDirector. Back to Dinosaur Island is a pre-scripted dinosaur experience in a jungle. There could be similaritied to other gameplay videos of the game.<br /><br />Time effort to create this video: 45 minutes<br /><br />You need to use 3D ANAGLYPH GLASSES to get a 3D effect.<br /><br />What is ANAGLYPH 3D?<br />*********************<br />Anaglyph is a type of stereo 3D image created from two cameras taken approximately 2.5 inches apart, the center distance typically between human eyes. The Red color field of the left photo is combined with that of the right photo in such a way as to create the illusion of depth.<br /><br />VIEWING: <br />********<br />Viewing an anaglyph 3D stereo image is easy. All you need is a Red filter over your left eye and a Cyan filter over the right eye (3D ANAGLYPH GLASSES RED/CYAN).<br />Now, once you have the filters over your eyes, just relax and allow yourself time to get into the picture. Your eyes will cross slightly as the image comes into 3D focus.<br /><br />More information about ANAGLYPH 3D:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stcroixstudios.com/wilder/anaglyph/whatsanaglyph.html">http://stcroixstudios.com/wilder/anaglyph/whatsanaglyph.html</a><br /><br />Buy the game BACK TO DINOSAUR ISLAND from Steam/Valve:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/412940">https://steamcommunity.com/app/412940</a><br /><br />YouTube Streaming Permission by Steam/Valse<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/video_policy">https://store.steampowered.com/video_policy</a>{% endraw %}
