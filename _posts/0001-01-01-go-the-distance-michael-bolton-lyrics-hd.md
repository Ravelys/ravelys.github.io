{% raw %}Dedicated To Our Brave Soldiers!<br /><br /> Brave men rejoice in adversity just as brave soldiers triumph in War-Charles Spurgeon<br /><br /> The song is Also the soundtrack to the 1997 Disney animated film Hercules.<br /><br />Welcome To My YouTube Channel <br />I Hope You Like All Of my Videos You can Subscribe Give Us a Thumbs Up.<br /><br />Ask Me Questions In The Comment Box! <br /><br />Facebook: Keisha Lhey Dandoy<br />Musical.ly: KeishaLhey<br />Email: Keisha Lhey Dandoy<br /><br /><br />Go The Distance- Michael Bolton W/Lyrics<br /><br /><br />I have often dreamed of a far off place<br />Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me<br />Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face<br />And a voice keeps saying, this is where I'm meant to be<br /><br />I'll be there someday, I can go the distance<br />I will find my way if I can be strong<br />I know every mile, will be worth my while<br />When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong<br /><br />Down an unknown road to embrace my fate<br />Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you<br />And a thousand years would be worth the wait<br />It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through<br /><br />And I won't look back, I can go the distance<br />And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat<br />It's an uphill slope but I won't lose hope<br />'Til I go the distance, and my journey is complete<br /><br />But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part<br />For a hero's strength is measured by his heart<br /><br />Like a shooting star, I will go the distance<br />I will search the world, I will face its harms<br />I don't care how far, I can go the distance<br />'Til I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms<br /><br />I will search the world, I will face its harms<br />'Til I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms{% endraw %}
