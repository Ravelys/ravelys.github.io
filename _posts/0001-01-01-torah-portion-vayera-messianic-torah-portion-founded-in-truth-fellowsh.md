It is through His spirit by which we find our common bond. Through the paradox of His death on the cross, we find the way to Godâ€™s love, the truth of all He is, and the life that only He can provide â€“ one that is eternal. The gospel of Yeshua is the foundation for our community locally and beyond.<br /><br />â–ºâ–ºFamilyâ—„â—„<br />If there is one thing we celebrate at Founded in Truth, it is family. Whether your household is small or large, local or far away, you are invited to take your place here with us. We thrive together to build up an atmosphere that shows forth Godâ€™s love in a very real way not just to be a fellowship but also to teach the children in the community what being an image bearer is all about.<br /><br />â–ºâ–ºFellowshipâ—„â—„<br />We value each other. In the Beginning, God said it was not good for man to be alone. We were meant for fellowship, and we believe when we come together, we celebrate Godâ€™s goodness, promises, and grace. We know God has called our lives to intersect, so what better way to fulfill the command of scripture to love one another?<br /><br />Founded in Truth Fellowship<br />1689 Springsteen rd<br />Rock Hill, SC 29730<br />www.foundedintruth.com{% endraw %}
