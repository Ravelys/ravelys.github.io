{% raw %}Join me, Orly Shani, as I show you how to make an INCREDIBLE No-Sew Sequin Gown with a  sexy plunging v-neck.<br /><br />Check out my latest videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Ml7kFlBsR0zcOuPhefnLDgTjZRM1RpP">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Ml7kFlBsR0zcOuPhefnLDgTjZRM1RpP</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWqS4gVZEUOIS345CKRmPA/?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWqS4gVZEUOIS345CKRmPA/?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br /><br />This week on DIY Designer, we are making an EPIC no-sew gown that anyone can do, no matter your skillset. First, you need some fabric that is a statement in itself and that has the width to cover your entire body. Then you must cut it into four equal pieces. Once these are ready to go, tie them at the shoulder and make them into bows. Then all you have left to do is to wrap it and belt it. Make sure to tuck everything in so it looks nice and in its place. The rest is up to you and your skillset to how you want to personalize it. This DIY gown is that simple! You will not only dazzle everyone with the flow of the dress and its sequins, but you will also have your own statement piece perfect for a special occasion or a night out on the town.<br /><br />Make sure to VOTE for me in the American Influencer Awards:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aiaawards.com/vote/?maincategory=2&amp;category=22">https://www.aiaawards.com/vote/?maincategory=2&amp;category=22</a><br /><br />If you try my DIYs, make sure to tag me on my socials!<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/orlyshani">https://www.instagram.com/orlyshani</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/orlyshani">https://twitter.com/orlyshani</a><br /><br />#DIY #OrlyShani #SequinGown{% endraw %}
