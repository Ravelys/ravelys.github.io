{% raw %}Edmund Optics offers a variety of ball bearing, crossed roller bearing, dovetail, and rack and pinion translation stages (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.edmundoptics.com/stages/)">http://www.edmundoptics.com/stages/)</a> for linear translation, rotary (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.edmundoptics.com/rotary/),">http://www.edmundoptics.com/rotary/),</a> and tip-tilt (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.edmundoptics.com/tip-tilt/)">http://www.edmundoptics.com/tip-tilt/)</a> movement. Before selecting which translation stage is best for your application, it is important to consider the types of adjustment required, how finely the adjustment must be made, and the total adjustment range needed. Join Katie Schwertz, Design Engineer, as she reviews degrees of freedom, mechanical movement, translation stage construction, and a host of other important concepts for manual translation stages.{% endraw %}
