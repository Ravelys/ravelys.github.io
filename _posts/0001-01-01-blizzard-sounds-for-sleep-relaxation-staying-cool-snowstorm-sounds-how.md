Our channel helps provide relief from stress &amp; anxiety. <br /><br />🎥 Our videos are currently filmed with a GoPro Hero7 &amp; iPhoneX. We edit, mix, and master the audio in Protools &amp; create the video in Premiere Pro. In the past, we sometimes collaborated with other video creators (with legal permission), which we would significantly transform into something new and add our own unique music and sounds.<br /><br />🎶 We create all our own music with our own instruments. My Mother (Elita) and I are both musicians and have played for many years.<br /><br />➡️ For more information on how we create our videos please watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hK9lwdqBJQ">https://youtu.be/4hK9lwdqBJQ</a><br /><br />🌀 MP3 DOWNLOADS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stardustvibes.com">https://www.stardustvibes.com</a><br />🌀 FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/stardustvibes/">https://www.facebook.com/stardustvibes/</a><br />🌀 INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stardust_vibes/">https://www.instagram.com/stardust_vibes/</a><br />🌀 TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/StardustVibes">https://twitter.com/StardustVibes</a><br />🌀 GOOGLE+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Q68t3RPUwgI">https://youtu.be/Q68t3RPUwgI</a><br />🌀 YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/I8guP5">https://goo.gl/I8guP5</a><br />🌀 THIS VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7BrIJrjxVxA">https://youtu.be/7BrIJrjxVxA</a><br /><br />#blizzard<br />#snowstorm<br />#sleepsounds<br />#relaxingsounds<br />#naturesounds<br />#winter<br /><br />© Stardust Vibes, 2017.
