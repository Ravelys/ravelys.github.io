{% raw %}I’m sharing my Anti aging eating habits after 40 in “what I eat in a day”. For $90 off across your first 5 Green Chef boxes, go to  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.greenchef.us/blushwithme90">https://www.greenchef.us/blushwithme90</a>  and enter code blushwithme90! Thank you to Green Chef for sponsoring this video! <br />My food keeps my gut clean and boosts metabolism to lose weight fast.<br /><br />With age your body’s metabolism slows down and that makes it harder to stay fit over 40. Strict diets are hard to implement as a healthy lifestyle but understanding how to eat well and how to trick your body into eating better, not only help you stay fit after 40 or over 50 but it will keep you energetic, keep your gut clean, you won’t feel bloated and lethargic and you will even gain muscle. Teach your body to eat to boost metabolism.<br />Looking good and feeling good go hand in hand. <br />Let me know your fav tip from this video #blushwithmeparmita 🙌<br /><br />⭐️Work with me📲Website: www.parmitakatkar.com <br />Email to work with me: info@blushwithme.com 💥COMING SOON!
