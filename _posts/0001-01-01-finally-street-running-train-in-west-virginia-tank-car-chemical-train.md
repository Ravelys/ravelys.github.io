{% raw %}Listen to this 7am wake up call!!  After 2 days a CSX street running freight train came right down the middle of the road in the middle of the city!   This is a street runner train in Saint Marys, West Virginia.  The train is sharing the road with cars and trucks as it passes several blocks in the city hauling tank cars, covered hopper cars and flat cars.  Awesome how the tracks are in the pavement and right under the windows of apartments.  This train came through right at 7am and was the first train in over 2 days to go through in the light.  I got a motel and waited for a daylight train.  I had to wait over 2 days and spent 2 nights in a motel downtown.  Only 4 trains went through while we here and 3 of them were in the dark.    See my video of a night time train passing through with horns blowing.  I have been here before but it has been a few years and with the decline in coal there just are not many trains left on this line.  Check out the traffic signals.  As you can see in the intro they flash red for the cross traffic and flash yellow for traffic running with the trains.  Usually this town is pretty busy with traffic and pedestrians but at 7am most people are still in bed.  I noticed some people in one second floor apartment close their windows.  I would love to spend a week in one of those units looking right down on the train in a historic building on the second or third floor.  Leave a comment and tell me if you could live in one of those apartments over the tracks.   The train was filmed on July 14, 2021.  Following the train is an up to date video of the new kitty and Chessie my dog.<br />   Thanks for watching!<br /> Please thumbs up and watch another JawTooth video to help my channel.  The views and the ads help keep me on the road.     <br /><br />      Check out my steam train playlist for some really cool videos including the Big Boy!       I also have other railroad videos of all types including short lines, street runners and cabooses in action.
