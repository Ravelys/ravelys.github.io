{% raw %}The Spring Lake Park Schools opened a new K-4 elementary school in 2018, capitalizing on the opportunity to embrace a progressive educational program. At the center of Centerview Elementary, the  learning commons acts as a shared gathering space for both the school and the greater community. Emphasizing flexible and personal learning at the elementary level, the school utilizes learning studios that accommodate individual, small group, large group, and multiple-class sizes. <br />Everything, including furniture and operable walls, is multi-functional in the learning studios and make them flexible from top to bottom. Centerview Elementary Schoolâ€™s design reflects the district's philosophy, focusing on learning styles rather than teaching preferences. Students lead their own path to learning while teachers coach the process. The school itself functions as a tool for the teachers rather than as a backdrop for learning.{% endraw %}
