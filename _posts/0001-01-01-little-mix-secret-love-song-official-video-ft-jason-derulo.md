Does it feel the same?<br />Would you leave if I was ready to settle down<br />Or would you play it safe and stay?<br /><br />Girl, you know this<br />We got a love that is hopeless<br /><br />Why can't you hold me in the street?<br />Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?<br />I wish that it could be like that<br />Why can't we be like that?<br />'Cause I'm yours<br /><br />And nobody knows I'm in love with someone's baby<br />I don't wanna hide us away<br />Tell the world about the love we're making<br />I'm living for that day<br />Someday<br /><br />Why can't I hold you in the street?<br />Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?<br />I wish that we could be like that<br />Why can't we be like that?<br />'Cause I'm yours, I'm yours<br /><br />Oh, why can't you hold me in the street?<br />Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?<br />I wish that it could be like that<br />Why can't it be like that?<br />'Cause I'm yours<br /><br />Why can't I say that I'm in love?<br />I wanna shout it from the rooftop<br />I wish that it could be like that<br />Why can't we be like that?<br />'Cause I'm yours<br /><br />Why can't we be like that?<br />Wish we could be like that<br /><br />#LittleMix #SecretLoveSong #JasonDerulo #10YearsOfLittleMix #Pop{% endraw %}
