{% raw %}I recently spent 2 weeks in New Zealand's MIQ - managed isolation facility - and decided to make a video to show you what it's like, how I spent my time, and of course what the food was like!<br /><br />Essentially MIQ is a 2-week stay in a hotel (…but you end up going a bit crazy), so one of my entertainment tactics was making this video, along with art/yoga/snacks/and staring into space.<br /><br />MIQ is one of the covid-19 elimination strategy precautions that NZ uses to keep coronavirus out. There are over 30 hotels dotted around the country and overall I was pretty impressed with their organization and care throughout the entire process.<br /><br />* All of this information is from my own experience of MIQ - the covid situation and management of it constantly changes.
