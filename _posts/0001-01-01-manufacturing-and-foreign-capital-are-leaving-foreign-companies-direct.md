{% raw %}Although it's not usually easy to relocate a business, in recent years a trend is forming for foreign companies to move out of China. <br />Some U.S. companies have already started it after the U.S.-China trade war broke out in 2016. Now Korea and Japan, as well as some European countries, are joining the action.<br />The Chinese Communist Party or CCP denied this trend on several occasions in August 2021, even calling it a rumor.  <br /><br />Have questions?
