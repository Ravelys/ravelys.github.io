In this section, we’ll scratch the surface of syntax as it applies to English grammar.  Much more can be said about this subject, but we’ll save that for KA Linguistics.<br /><br /><br />About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.
