{% raw %}- I need to go to the store.<br /><br />- I have to go to the store.<br /><br />- I must go to the store.<br /><br />Do these sentences mean the same thing? Can we always use them in the same way?<br /><br />Let’s find out in today’s Confident English lesson.<br /><br />Need to vs. have to vs. must can be used as synonyms. Sometimes. That’s the good news.<br /><br />Generally, they all mean that you’re talking about a responsibility, an obligation, or something that is important to do. This is where they are similar.
