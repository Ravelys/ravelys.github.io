Karin established the interior design firm over 10 years ago, and since has made her mark on the West-Coast Canadian design scene in many industries including high-end residential, multi-family, restaurants and retail. Karin’s passion to create is the reason behind her YouTube channel. In addition to working at the helm of her interior design firm, she experiments with storytelling and &quot;giving-back&quot; in a digital medium – video. Her self-titled YouTube channel is an on-going passion project and online world that’s not only a space to share her expertise in interior design, style and business, but is also dedicated to helping others grow their own successful businesses.<br /><br />#HouseofBohn #HoBProjectTours #interiordesign{% endraw %}
