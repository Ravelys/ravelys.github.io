{% raw %}The Honorable Philip D. Murphy, US Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, delivered the keynote address to the fall 2011 class. Following Ambassador Murphy's introduction, each fall fellow gave a short presentation of their projects, ranging from the medieval culture of writing pre-Gutenberg to the creation of a new suite of poems, from the curious German letters of Samuel Beckett to the unseen affinities between multiculturalism and neoliberalism. Over the coming three months, each fellow will deliver a public lecture or reading at the Hans Arnhold Center, all open to the public (view the complete program on our website www.americanacademy.de).{% endraw %}
