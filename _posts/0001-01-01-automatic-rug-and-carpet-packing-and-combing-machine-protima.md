{% raw %}Finishing machine Tornado F-3000 is able to brush, vacuum, and roll up previously washed and dried rugs. You can operate the machine in a comfortable, standing position. One can adjust the brush pressure and the speed of the rug feed. The brushes lift up rugs’ pile while dry dirt is vacuumed and collected in a special absorber attached to the machine. Due to special sensors, the device can recognize the beginning and the end of the rug. That is why the finisher’s operation is extremely easy and pleasant. Tornado F-3000 is a mobile device, so it can be set anywhere in the plant, for instance close to drying racks or a storage rack.<br /><br />our offer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.protima.eu/EN-H59/offer.html">https://www.protima.eu/EN-H59/offer.html</a><br />follow us on FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/protimaworld/notifications/">https://www.facebook.com/protimaworld/notifications/</a><br /><br />Sales Department<br />Taras Tanskyi<br />+48 796 815 748 (Whatsapp &amp; Viber)<br /><br />#carpet_packing_machine#rug_combing_machine#protima{% endraw %}
