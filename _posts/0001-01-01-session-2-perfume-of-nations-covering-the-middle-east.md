{% raw %}“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” John 1:5 (ESV)<br /><br />As our family in Afghanistan, Lebanon and the Middle East are going through an intense time of shaking now, we want to gather as one Body to declare life over these regions, that His light might shine through and remove any veil that hinders love. Just as a nation can be born in one day, we believe that the atmosphere will shift as we bring our brothers and sisters before the throneroom. His Kingdom will be manifest. His love, mercy, and strength will overflow to all those in need.<br />Please join us as we gather on September 11th for “Perfume of Nations” from 5AM - 7PM PDT (Vancouver) for 14 hours of worship from many nations, colours, tribes, and tongues.<br /><br />Session 2 Schedule: <br />8:40-9:45 AM Singapore <br />9:45-10:45 Israel<br />10:45-11:25 France<br />11:25-12:25 Germany<br />12:25-1:25 PM Ireland<br />1:25-2:25 PM Japan{% endraw %}
