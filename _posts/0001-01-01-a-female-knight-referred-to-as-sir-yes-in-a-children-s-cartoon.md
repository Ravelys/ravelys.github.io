{% raw %}It’s arguable that Google is ostensibly one of the world’s most progressive and politically woke organisations. In recent times, they have asked their programmers to steer away from using politically incorrect terminology such as “blacklist” and “whitelist”, “master” and “slave”. Apparently, “blacklist” and “whitelist” reinforce the notion that black=bad and white=good. Anyway, make of that what you will. But sometimes that comes back to bite them. “Google staff accuse company of 'racism and censorship' in dispute over ethics researcher Timnit Gebru”. Ethiopian-born artificial intelligence scholar Dr Gebru dared to criticise Google’s technology identifying racial bias in facial recognition software. Google apparently accepted her resignation even though she never resigned! So obviously, Google are woke in name only. Nevertheless, for the sake of argument, I’m only going to use Google search dictionary definitions in this video so that I’m getting the most woke and up-to-date meanings of each of these words. Knight: (in the Middle Ages) a man who served his sovereign or lord as a mounted soldier in armour. Sir: used as a title before the forename of a knight or baronet. Okay, so clearly these are masculine terms, but a recent children’s TV show that my young children are currently watching and enjoying immensely are trying to turn these definitions on their head.
