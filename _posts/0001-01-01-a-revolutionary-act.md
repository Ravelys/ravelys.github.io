{% raw %}The fight for Black liberation lives on within Chairman Fred Hampton's  fiancée and former Black Panther Akua Njeri and their son, Chairman Fred Hampton Jr. We’re excited to premiere our new ten-minute short digital film, “A Revolutionary Act'', about the life and work of Illinois Black Panther Party Chairman Fred Hampton, directed by the talented rising star, MALAKAI. Inspired by the film JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH, this passion project aims to help us unlearn what we were taught about the Black Panther Party in order to truly understand their legacy of love and service to their community.<br /><br />SAVE THE HAMPTON HOUSE <br />The #SaveTheHamptonHouse initiative is not just about protecting and restoring Chairman Fred Hampton’s childhood home-- it is a fight for a space to hold important, revolutionary discussions based on real historical context. Let’s help Chairman Fred’s son, Chairman Fred Hampton Jr., #SaveTheHamptonHouse as a crucial first step into reckoning with the true history and legacy of the Black Panther Party and inspiring future leaders in the movement for Black liberation.
