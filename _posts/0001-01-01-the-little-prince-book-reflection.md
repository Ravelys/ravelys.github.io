{% raw %}Philosophical books are some of my favourite ones, especially fictional ones (I definitely have a lot of exploring to do!). I recently read the book &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry and here's some reflection on it. Do you enjoy these book review -ish videos?<br /><br />I have two questions that I'd love for you to answer:<br /><br />What's your book-reading routine? (taking notes, reflection etc)<br />How would you define happiness in one sentence?<br /><br />My social media: <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/lanablakely">http://www.instagram.com/lanablakely</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/lanablakelys">http://www.facebook.com/lanablakelys</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/lanablakelys">http://www.twitter.com/lanablakelys</a>{% endraw %}
