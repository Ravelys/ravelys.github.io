I started with a pretty cheap (but metal) 8.5&quot;x11&quot; frame with a mat, which I measured. Then I created a design with Illustrator using a bunch of random shapes, which I imported into Rhino so that I could convert the vector file into a 3d image. This was slightly difficult because Rhino extrudes lines into shapes best when they are &quot;closed curves&quot; and many of the lines I imported were not ideally formatted, which I hope to improve on the next time I try this.<br /><br />Then I printed the designs using a Prusa i3 printer using PLA filament, and I glued the pieces to the frame with 2-part epoxy. After that I completed the assembled frame matte black, and proceeded to draw a picture to put inside it. I used cardstock and Kaweco Sport fountain pens for the drawing, with Platinum Carbon Black ink.<br /><br />Buy this piece here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.peterdraws.com/shop/depletable">https://www.peterdraws.com/shop/depletable</a><br /><br />My new book Dayfever: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WWIFuK">https://amzn.to/2WWIFuK</a><br />The rest of my books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00HVOQ27S">https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00HVOQ27S</a><br /><br />Instagram........... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/peterdraws/">https://www.instagram.com/peterdraws/</a><br />Twitter................. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PeterDraws1">https://twitter.com/PeterDraws1</a><br />Patreon............... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/peterdraws">https://www.patreon.com/peterdraws</a><br />Twitch................. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/peterdraws">https://www.twitch.tv/peterdraws</a><br /><br />My Website......... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.peterdraws.com/">https://www.peterdraws.com/</a><br />Email................... peter@peterdraws.com{% endraw %}
