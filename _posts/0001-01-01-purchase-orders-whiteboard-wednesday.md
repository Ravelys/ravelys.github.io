{% raw %}What does a purchase order do? That is the big question that James Shores tackles in this episode of Whiteboard Wednesday. Purchase orders are contracts between you and your vendors, so if a dispute arises, it can be settled by going back to the purchase order and seeing if it was completely fulfilled as it specified.<br /><br />Purchase orders can be forgotten or completely disregarded in some cases, but that leaves businesses vulnerable. It's much better to have everything written down in purchase orders to prevent misunderstandings and other errors that can cause problems in supply chain management and order management.<br /><br />Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday answers big inventory management questions in just a couple of minutes. Fishbowl is responsible for making the No. 1 manufacturing and warehouse management software for QuickBooks users.{% endraw %}
