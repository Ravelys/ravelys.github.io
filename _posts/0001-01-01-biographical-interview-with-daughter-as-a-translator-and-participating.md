It was the perfect moment to capture her stories ! While she understood English and spoke it as well Her daughter helped along in the interview by translating to seek clarity and to do the follow-up questions. We can easily add a second language soundtrack if desired. Meanwhile, we not only captured her stories for thje family, we also created a unique video document in her own African language - Kikuyu ! That is cool !{% endraw %}
