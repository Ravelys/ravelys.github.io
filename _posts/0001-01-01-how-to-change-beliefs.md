{% raw %}A belief, particularly core beliefs operate in our unconscious. That means that we don't know they are there. It is as if we were hypnotized and behave in ways we don't want to. We wake up after our emotional reaction or unwanted behavior and wonder why we did what we did.  <br /><br />We only see our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that unconscious beliefs produce. The exercises from my Self Mastery Course, and my book MindWorks allow you become aware of these core beliefs and change the beliefs, emotions, and false sense of identity that form them. This is how you make changes at a core belief level.{% endraw %}
