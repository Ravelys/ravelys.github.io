{% raw %}dad tricked me and we turned into Mermaids üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! Today my dad told me that he wanted the video to be a surprise!! He told me just to be ready to have a really fun time! The only clue he would give me to what we were doing was &quot;thgif wollip&quot; and I had NO IDEA what that meant!! He also told me that before we could play the game I needed to sign a contract and then we could get started with the fun! But, something crazy happened with I signed my name!! I felt magic through my body and I turned into a little mermaid, like Ariel! I had a new fish tail and I couldn't stand up! Then my dad told me that by signing the paper I activated some magic and I was now a mermaid forever!! I then thought of a funny idea and tricked my dad to sign his name too and now we are both mermaids!! He then read the contract to me and it says that if we ever want to be humans again we have to have a pillow fight and whoever wins will turn back into a person!! We agreed to follow the rules and shook hands and turned back into humans for a little bit! We then gathered all the pillows in the house and took them outside to have the biggest pillow fight ever right in our backyard!! We piled them up on the trampoline and then got started with a really fun time! My dad was really good but I was so fast and strong I started to beat him at his own game! I then had a the best idea ever and told my dad that we needed to play with the love sack and bring it outside with us! When we went inside we found mom and niko and we asked them if they wanted to join us on this fun adventure! We then just played for a long time and had a really fun time as a family!!<br /><br />my last video - ADLEY SPiN GAME!!
