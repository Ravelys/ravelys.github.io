{% raw %}We present a training set-up that achieves fast policy generation for real-world robotic tasks by using massive parallelism on a single workstation GPU. The parallel approach allows training policies for flat terrain in under 4 minutes, and in 20 minutes for uneven terrain. <br /><br />Paper accepted to CoRL 2021.<br />The corresponding code will be released soon.<br />Paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11978">https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11978</a>{% endraw %}
