Her crew-mate Rand is no help, resigned to his fate on the hypnotic alien dunes. Locating the ship's emergency beacon is their only hope, but when a salvage crew answers their distress signal, it's already too late. <br /><br />&quot;Beachworld&quot; by Jackie Perez <br /><br />Connect with the Filmmakers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beachworldfilm.com/">https://www.beachworldfilm.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jackierageperez.com/">https://www.jackierageperez.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BeachworldFilm/">https://www.facebook.com/BeachworldFilm/</a><br /><br />More About &quot;Beachworld&quot;:<br />Beachworld is an adaptation of a Stephen King’s short story as part of his Dollar Baby program. Lieutenant Shapiro’s ship is destroyed in a crash on a deserted desert planet covered in sand dunes. As she begins to understand the severity of her situation, she sets out to discover other survivors and formulate a rescue plan. Her crewmate Rand is alive, but spellbound by his new surroundings. It’s up to her alone to figure out how to get back home. She finds their ship’s emergency beacon, and an unsavory salvage crew answers their distress call. Ultimately, their rescue comes too late as Shapiro has succumbed to the planet’s hypnotizing effect.<br /><br />&quot;Beachworld&quot; Credits:<br />Written and Directed by Jackie Perez<br />Produced by Brian Campeau<br />Director of Photography Sarah Phillips<br />Edited by Rudy Nazzarano, Jackie Perez<br />Music &amp; Sound Design by Michael Clebanoff<br />Make-up &amp; Special Effects by Chronix EFX<br /><br />CAST<br />Lt.
