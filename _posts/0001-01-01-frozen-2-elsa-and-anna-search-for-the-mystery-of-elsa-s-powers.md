{% raw %}Frozen 2, Elsa and Anna Search For the Mystery of Elsa’s Powers.  The Fun Squad become the characters of Frozen 2 – Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and even Sven!   Watch as the team journeys to the Enchanted Forest in search to answers to Elsa’s questions and the history of Arendelle.  Will Elsa find who’s behind the voice and discover who is calling her?  Will Elsa be able to tame the nature spirits with her powers?   <br />What is your favorite Frozen movie?  Is it Frozen?  Or is it Frozen 2?  Have you seen the new Frozen movie that just came out in 2019?<br />Elsa is such an amazing character and so is Anna, the kids loved playing these amazing characters.<br />In honor of the awesome new “Frozen 2” movie now out in theaters, we thought it would be fun to do some Frozen videos for everyone.<br />Elsa is played by Jazzy Skye and she did amazing also! Kalia is our little Anna in this fun video and she is actually the one that sings the whole cover song in the &quot;Do You Want to Build a Snowman&quot; video also!  Jack plays Kristoff and Olaf is played by Kade.  A friend of ours, Chloe, plays Anna also.<br />What’s your favorite Frozen song?  Is it this song, “Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” Or do you like the song “Let It Go” better? Or is it, “For the First Time in Forever”?  What about the new songs in Frozen 2?  Have you heard the new song called, “Into the Unknown”? Or do you have a different Frozen song that is your favorite?<br />The Fun Squad kids at Kids Fun TV have had so much fun watching each new Frozen 2 trailer this year and we watched the new Frozen 2 movie right when it came out in theaters.  We really think the new Frozen 2 will be as awesome of a movie as the original Frozen movie was.<br />Elsa and Anna are such great sisters, and Jazzy and Kalia are such great sisters in real life also (and cute kids also).  Jazzy and Kalia had so much fun playing Anna and Elsa in this Frozen video.<br />What do you think about our cute little girl Kalia?  We think she did so amazing in the Do You Wanna Build a Snowman video and also in the Frozen 2 skit video we did.  We had so much fun filming this fun Frozen music video in real life and the Frozen 2 video.  Kristoff makes an appearance in our video,s and you will also see Olaf!  Olaf the snowman was played by our cute little Kyler and by Kade.<br />Elsa and Anna are going to be huge stars in the new Frozen 2 movie coming out this week!  All of the fun Frozen characters will be in the new Frozen 2 video and we have some fun surprises on Kids Fun TV with a few more awesome Frozen and Frozen 2 videos coming out soon.  <br />Go check out the new Frozen 2 movie in theaters this week!
