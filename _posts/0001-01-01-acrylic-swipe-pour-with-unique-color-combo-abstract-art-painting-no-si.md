This results in quite random results. Every picture is unique.<br /><br />----------------<br />1. acrylic paint<br />----------------<br /><br />You can use what you like here. Acrylic paints from brand companies usually have a thicker consistency and therefore lower consumption. Cheap brands are often thinner, you need a little more color. These are the bands I mainly use.<br /><br />Look for what suits you and your wallet. Possibly. you have to adjust my Pouring recipe, which comes down below with your acrylic paint something.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IO2zBI">https://amzn.to/2IO2zBI</a> (advertising Amazon.com*)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WQz7A6">https://amzn.to/2WQz7A6</a> (advertising Amazon.com *)<br /><br />---------------------<br />2. The Pouring Medium<br />---------------------<br />The only pouring medium I used was a 60/40 Glue &amp; Floetrol mix with a bit of water. <br />The Pouring Medium ensures that the acrylic paint is fluid and pourable. There are now many varieties available. Liquitex is also a good option, even without silicone oil beautiful cells are possible.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IO4hTE">https://amzn.to/2IO4hTE</a>  (Glue) (advertising Amazon.com*)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IRUThN">https://amzn.to/2IRUThN</a>  (Floetrol) (advertising Amazon.com*)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WNHLPJ">https://amzn.to/2WNHLPJ</a> (Liquitex) (advertising Amazon.com*)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MU4Gcz">https://amzn.to/2MU4Gcz</a> (advertising Amazon.com *)<br /><br />--------<br />3. Water<br />--------<br /><br />Only acrylic paint and casting medium is usually not enough, the color must be made a little more liquid, but I use normal tap water. In the end, the ready-mixed color should flow evenly off the stirring tool like warm liquid honey.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />4. Final treatment<br />------------------<br /><br />If the pictures have dried after about 3-5 days, the acrylic paint will not shine as well as when wet. To restore this shine, use the Pouring Medium. But you can also use a special gloss varnish to create even more shine.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31BZGN7">https://amzn.to/31BZGN7</a> (advertising Amazon.com *)<br /><br />Otherwise, you only need a canvas in its preferred size and a few cups to touch the colors.<br /><br /><br />----------------------<br />My acrylic pouring recipe<br />----------------------<br /><br /><br />1 part color<br />1 part Pouring Medium<br />1/2 part of water<br /><br />!!! Important, the canvas must first be primed with Acrylic Pouring Medium or paint otherwise, the edges absorb too much paint.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br />Cast acrylic - quantity calculation<br />How much color is needed for his canvas?<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />Approximately 0.3 grams per square centimetre, this is the complete mixture meant. Suppose you have a canvas of 40 x 40 cm = 1600cm2. Calculation 1600 x 0.3 grams = 480 grams of the complete mixture so all colors, pouring medium and water added up.<br /><br />For a 40x40 cm two-color image, the mix looks like this:<br /><br />Rounded up to 500 grams so that no later color is missing:<br /><br />100 g of colorful paint<br />100 g of fluid medium <br />50 g of water<br /><br />100 g white color<br />100 g of fluid medium<br />50 g of water<br /><br />On the bottles is usually a millilitre indication, you can take that in grams, 250 ml color is not exactly 250 g, but the difference does not matter.<br /><br />TECH GEAR USED:<br />Camera #1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Cq38N4">https://amzn.to/3Cq38N4</a><br />Camera #2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3s2dSMS">https://amzn.to/3s2dSMS</a><br />Camera #3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3yCyM7K">https://amzn.to/3yCyM7K</a><br />Overhead Cam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VuRoZc">https://amzn.to/2VuRoZc</a><br />Tripods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jxpofr">https://amzn.to/3jxpofr</a><br />Lighting: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lKnf2K">https://amzn.to/3lKnf2K</a><br />Light #2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fKRQcF">https://amzn.to/3fKRQcF</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Anmpgq">https://amzn.to/3Anmpgq</a><br />SD Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jAyiJ1">https://amzn.to/3jAyiJ1</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Links included in this description might be affiliate links.
