{% raw %}#HebrewAsAnAdditionalLanguage<br />#IVRIKAL is an initiative that grew out of a desire to help teachers who wish to integrate authentic material in their #Hebrew class.<br />We offer authentic content and 21st century learning assignments in a way that enables teachers to integrate the materials into an existing program or to build a new program based on the conceptual continuum in which the topics appear in the themes.{% endraw %}
