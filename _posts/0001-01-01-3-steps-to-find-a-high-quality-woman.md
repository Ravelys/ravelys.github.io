{% raw %}Every man has a slightly different idea of what a high quality woman means to him, but there are some similarities. <br /><br />For example, over the years, I’ve found that many men will list off the following traits when describing what a high quality woman means to them:<br /><br />- Beautiful.<br />- Intelligent.<br />- Down to earth.<br />- Easy going.<br />- Good sense of humor.<br />- Traditional/non-traditional.<br /><br />From there, a man will then go into specifics to further describe other qualities or traits that he wants in a woman.<br /><br />For example, some guys prefer women who want to be a stay at home mother, whereas other guys like women who are into partying and never want to have a family. <br /><br />Other guys prefer women who are career-driven and are mostly focused on achieving big things outside of the home.<br /><br />The list goes on (watch the video for more examples). Yet, one thing is for sure…<br /><br />If you want to be happy with the woman that you choose to settle down with, it’s essential that you be very clear on what a high quality woman means to you.<br /><br />Then, don’t deviate from that. <br /><br />Say to yourself that you won’t accept anything less than what you see as a high quality woman.<br /><br />When you have that mindset, you will notice that you begin to only feel interested in the women who seem like they have the type of look, qualities and value that you want.<br /><br />…and then something interesting happens.<br /><br />Women can SENSE that you’re not one of those desperate guys who is trying to get pretty much ANY half decent woman.<br /><br />Instead, you have enough confidence in yourself and enough self respect to have real standards, which is a very attractive trait to women.<br /><br />However, don’t stop there.<br /><br />If you want a high quality woman, the next step is to truly know what to say and do to make the woman feel attracted to you when you meet her, so you don’t end up missing out on the opportunities that you have along the way.<br /><br />The reality is that when you’re able to create sparks of attraction as you talk to women and then quickly connect with them, you will see that women feel amazing chemistry with you and want something to happen (i.e. for you and her to exchange numbers, go on a date, kiss, have sex and start a relationship).<br /><br />By the way…<br /><br />If you struggle with having the confidence to approach and talk to women that you find attractive, or if you don’t really know how to make women feel attracted to you and connected to you as you talk to them, then I recommend that you read my eBook The Flow, or listen to the audiobook version, The Flow on Audio.<br /><br />The Flow:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-ebook.html">https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-ebook.html</a><br /><br />The Flow on Audio:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-on-audio.html">https://www.themodernman.com/blog/the-flow-on-audio.html</a><br /><br />Okay, I’ll see you in the next video!<br /><br />Cheers<br />Dan Bacon <br /><br />P.S.
