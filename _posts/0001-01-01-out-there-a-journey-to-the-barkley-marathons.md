{% raw %}Instagram: @KarelSabbe<br />Facebook: Karel Sabbe Ultrarunning <br /><br />The Barkley Marathons - one of the world's toughest ultramarathons, has been held annually in the Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee, since 1987.<br />The race is so brutal that, since the inception of the race, only 15 people have managed to finish. Runners are to run five 20-mile loops, within a 60 hour time limit and with more than 20.000m of elevation change.<br />The course is unmarked, no electronic devices are allowed and most of the race is off-trail.<br /><br />Out There - A journey to the Barkley Marathons is the story of Belgian ultrarunner Karel Sabbe, who holds the world records on two of the most epic trails in the world: the 4279km long Pacific Crest Trail and the 3500km long Appalachian Trail.<br /><br />How did setting these world records prepare Karel for a race as brutal as &quot;the Barkley&quot;? How did these adventures help Karel to find the necessary mindset to do well at this Spartan challenge?<br /><br />Out There is a story of persistence, endurance and a passion for the great outdoors, and the film inspires the audience to reconnect with nature and to find courage for personal challenges.{% endraw %}
