{% raw %}This NEW 2 story home has just been completed and it's astonishing! This is a exciting new site built tour for our series &quot;Site Built Saturday!&quot; Hey friends, this is Chance and I have a custom house video tour video for you. Be sure to subscribe and like this video if you enjoy please!<br /><br />The home has a kitchen and main bathroom that will leave you speechless! I'm very grateful Tucker Construction allowed me tour this brand new house. This home has 6 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and has roughly 5,300 sq ft heated and cooled(around 6,000 total sqft). Let me know what you think about the video! I hope you enjoy this home walk through video.<br /><br />Also let me mention the price building estimates I gave are based on the heated &amp; cooled sq ft. However like I mentioned these are only estimates and mainly just my opinion based on what homes are being built for in this area!<br /><br />NEW Merch, click this link! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chanceshomemerch.com/">https://chanceshomemerch.com/</a><br /><br />Become a member of the channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUm_7AXxszAQBI1op35dlQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUm_7AXxszAQBI1op35dlQ/join</a><br /><br />Our Website Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mhmasters.com/?id=259">https://mhmasters.com/?id=259</a><br /><br />SECOND CHANNEL &quot;Camper Masters&quot; Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5flBlr--8WlqhLYNmhayw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5flBlr--8WlqhLYNmhayw</a><br /><br />Link for camera gimbal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2A9fqhi">https://amzn.to/2A9fqhi</a><br /><br />We have been in the mobile home business for years, and thought why not upload videos about something we can relate to and deal with every day.<br /><br />&quot;Site Built Saturday's&quot; is a new series I would like to add to the channel. Now this won't be every Saturday, for right now maybe only once or twice a month! The mission with this channel is to show you a good time and tour all types of homes, so I thought why not start sprinkling in some stick built homes here and there! Hope you all enjoy this house tour!<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chanceriderc/">https://www.instagram.com/chanceriderc/</a><br /><br />Be sure to subscribe to the channel and hit the notification bell so you will know when we post other videos like this. <br /><br />Also, if you enjoyed will you like this video and leave us a comment!<br /><br />Song Codes: <br />QFTB3CZHZNUTNDJV<br />TWCGNX4EOJ41KVKS<br />IE68TTYHUJH0BLGO<br /><br />#newhome #housetour #hometour{% endraw %}
