{% raw %}Extract from the heated press conference that took place in Athens, Greece on 9 November 2021, when dutch journalist, Ingeborg Beugel, asked the greek right-wing prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, about the occurrence of illegal refugee pushbacks in the Aegean Sea, during a joint news conference with the dutch prime minister Mark Rutte.<br /><br />&quot;There has been overwhelming evidence and you keep denying and lying. This is like narcissistic abuse. Why are you not honest? Why don't you say 'Brussels left us alone, we waited for 6 years, nobody did anything. Now I have a say and yes, I do cruel, barbarian pushbacks&quot;, Ingeborg Beugel said and Mitsotakis, being used το flattering questions by greek journalists, lost it completely.{% endraw %}
