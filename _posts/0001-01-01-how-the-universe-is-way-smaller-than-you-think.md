{% raw %}In this video we will cover 'How The Universe Is Way Smaller Than You Think'. I watched the video, How the Universe is Way Bigger Than You Think here...  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Iy7NzjCmUf0">https://youtu.be/Iy7NzjCmUf0</a> <br />And decided to show everyone that the universe is actually quite small (In once sense of the word. haha). Really small.<br /><br />We start off with one of the largest ancient wonders on earth, mount everest. Then we scale you downwards in the universe by going onto the blue whale, then humans, mosquitos, and fleas. It is around here that we get into micrometers and talk about the width of a human hair. <br /><br />We try to use as many electron microscopy images as possible to help you visualize what the micro world would look like. <br /><br />We move onto some things like keratinocytes, skin cells, red blood cells, and bacterial cells and show you the smallest living things on earth. <br /><br />However, the universe is even smaller than it is big (does that make sense?). So we keep venturing downwards. <br /><br />We jump into the nano world where we move from micrometers to nanometers. We talk about the wavelength go light, viruses, DNA, transistors, before using picometer to get into specfic atoms like the hydrogen atom, then protons and neutrons. <br /><br />Eventually we need to use femtometers, attometers, heptometers, and yoctometers to measure things like quarks, preons, and neutrinos. <br /><br />We lastly touch on quantam foam, the planck length, string theory, and a closing remark.<br /><br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br />Please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.joisk.com">https://www.joisk.com</a> to support this channel!<br /><br />Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/joiskinc">https://www.facebook.com/joiskinc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/joiskinc">https://www.instagram.com/joiskinc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/joiskinc">https://www.twitter.com/joiskinc</a>{% endraw %}
