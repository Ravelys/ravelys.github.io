{% raw %}WARNING: a bit lengthy listen to the Dreadbox Abyss, 4-voice analog(ue) synthesizer (I tried to cut the length down, but obviously failed).  This is NOT a review, and there's no talking past the introduction.  It's basically a big sound sampler focusing on chords, with a bit of lead and bass thrown in as well. (click &quot;show more&quot; for more commentary)<br /><br />When it comes to synths, this thing is retro-in-a-box.  And I'm talking sound most of all.  And in case you were wondering, the opening ProckGnosis theme for this video was done only with the Abyss and some VST drums.  <br /><br />Top 4 things I've discovered so far:<br />- If you want that &quot;Boards of Canada&quot; drifting oscillator sound (more recently overexposed in the &quot;Stranger Things&quot; soundtrack), this thing nails it<br />- The hybrid delay really does create a great chorus effect (the Erebus should be able to do this too, but I've never tried)<br />- Just a touch of &quot;drive&quot; on the VCA helps make the sound even more classic and...uh...not sure really, but I describe it as &quot;dirty&quot; in the video<br />- The selection of variable wave shapes sort of pushes this into OB6 territory, and being able to easily modulate the waves really pumps some life into the sound<br /><br />Again, hats off to Dreadbox for this kind of stuff.  I said somewhere, yeah, it's just a synthesizer, but they do it just a little bit differently, and that really makes it something more unique in the field of synths.  Cheers!{% endraw %}
