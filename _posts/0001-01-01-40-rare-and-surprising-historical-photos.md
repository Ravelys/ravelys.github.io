All of them deserve to be recognized and honored for being part of our past and allowing us to create a better present. I wish that their souls find peace and unite with God. From PERFECT LIFE we have been paying tribute to them since 2013 and together with you, we will continue to remind and thank them for never being forgotten. Personally, I want to thank all of them and you for allowing me to earn an honest living with this work, without them and without you it would not be possible.
