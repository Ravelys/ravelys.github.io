{% raw %}Knife Defense [Official video]<br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.codereddefense.com/products/knife-defense">https://www.codereddefense.com/products/knife-defense</a><br /><br />There are many factors to take into consideration in a knife fight. You need to think about the fact that it might be raining, you might be sweating, or even bleeding. These factors make the fight much more difficult. Forget about trapping a knife if you can't even get a steady grip on your opponent's arm because it's too slippery.<br /><br />There are other factors to take into consideration, like clothes, material objects, etc. If your opponent wants money, throw it at him and run. If he wants your keys, your jacket, your wallet, throw it and run. Create a split second of distraction that could allow you to get out of the situation alive.<br /><br />If you have managed to trap your attacker's knife but lose your grip, you need to prepare to strike back immediately while he doesn't see it coming. Speed is very important in this case. If you can't bridge the gap, try to use an improvised weapon to change the situation. Anything could work.<br /><br />Share the video with your loved ones and help them learn self defense:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xh6tBeeijQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xh6tBeeijQ</a><br /><br />Get a free self-defense video:<br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.codereddefense.com/newsletter">https://www.codereddefense.com/newsletter</a><br /><br />Stay safe,<br /><br />Nick Drossos and Patrick V<br />Code Red Defense<br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.codereddefense.com">https://www.codereddefense.com</a>{% endraw %}
