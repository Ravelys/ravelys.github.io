{% raw %}A perfect song, for lovers out there...<br /><br /><br /><br />You know I need your love, <br /><br />You got that hold over me<br /><br />Long as I got your love, <br /><br />You know that I'll never leave<br /><br />When I wanted you to share my life, <br /><br />I had no doubt in my mind<br /><br />And it's been you, <br /><br />woman, <br /><br />right down the line<br /><br />I know how much I lean on you, <br /><br />Only you can see<br /><br />Changes that I've been through, <br /><br />Have left their mark on me<br /><br />You've been as constant as the northern star, <br /><br />The brightest light that shines<br /><br />It's been you, <br /><br />woman, <br /><br />right down the line<br /><br />I just wanna say this is my way<br /><br />Of telling you everything,<br /><br />I could never say before<br /><br />Yeah this is my way <br /><br />of telling you that everyday, <br /><br />I'm loving you so much more<br /><br />Cause you believed in me <br /><br />through my darkest night<br /><br />Put something better inside of me, <br /><br />You brought me into the light<br /><br />Threw away all those crazy dreams, <br />I put them all behind<br /><br />And it was you, <br /><br />woman, <br /><br />right down the line<br /><br />I just wanna say <br /><br />this is my way<br /><br />Of telling you everything, <br /><br />I could never say before<br /><br />Yeah this is my way <br /><br />of telling you that everyday, <br /><br />I'm loving you so much more<br /><br />If I should doubt myself, <br /><br />If I'm losing ground<br /><br />I wont turn to someone else, <br /><br />They'd only let me down<br /><br />When I wanted you to share my life, <br />I had no doubt in my mind<br /><br />And it's been you, <br /><br />woman, <br /><br />right down the line{% endraw %}
