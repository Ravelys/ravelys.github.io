{% raw %}Speaking at a lecture series on Charles Spurgeon, Alistair Begg observes that much like John the Baptist, the famous Victorian-era preacher was multifaceted and peculiar. Both men were distinguished by the divine authority bestowed upon them, a helpful humility, clear integrity, unequivocal bravery, and simplicity. Most importantly, though, they both prioritized pointing away from themselves and directing the focus toward Jesus Christ. Our lives ought to emulate theirs and consistently proclaim, “Prepare the way of the Lord.”<br /><br />Scripture: Selected Scripture<br />Preached: October 18, 2016<br /><br />Find more sermons by Alistair Begg at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.truthforlife.org/resources/most-recent-sermons/">https://www.truthforlife.org/resources/most-recent-sermons/</a>{% endraw %}
