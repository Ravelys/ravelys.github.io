A song for a tired soul, wrought with wear and tear. <br />Art by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://manga.clone-army.org">http://manga.clone-army.org</a><br /><br />Lyrics<br />---------------------<br />They will tear her down <br />Piece by piece, seam by seam <br />They will murder everything <br />And all she has left is her angelic dream <br /><br />Lost to the rags <br />Stitch after stitch, she never gives up <br />Blood on her shirt again <br />But she does it all for love <br /><br />Petty like a petticoat <br />A whore for the words she wrote <br />That they never heard her speak <br />In a dress bespoke <br /><br />(Ooooo) <br />Sail away for that seifuku <br />And darling do feel comfortable just being you <br />Wear a smile, wear a frown <br />Wear it up when it wears you down, darling<br />Wear whatever you like <br /><br />They will tear her down <br />Prick after prick, yeah they're all the same <br />She's scars to tell the story of her words <br />That she hides 'cause she's ashamed <br /><br />Lost to the rags <br />Tears in her eyes and mud on her shoes <br />She wants to scream that she loves her <br />But they just make her sing the blues <br /><br />It wasn't 'bout the jeans she wore <br />'cause she's got the price tag in that store <br />It's not enough, it's not enough <br />It should be more <br /><br />(Ooooo) <br />Sail away for that seifuku <br />And darling do feel comfortable just being you <br />Wear a smile, wear a frown <br />Wear it up when it wears you down, darling<br />Wear whatever you like <br /><br />She's stronger than the Martins <br />Lacing up her boots <br />They feel heavy as the burden that she bears <br />Who cares what she wears <br />Try as you might <br />It's you she doesn't like <br /><br />Sail away for that seifuku <br />And darling do feel comfortable just being you <br />Wear a smile, wear a crown <br />I'll be there if you're feeling down <br />Darling, wear whatever you like <br /><br />(Ooooo) <br />Sail away for that seifuku <br />Wear a smile, wear a frown <br />Wear it up if it wears you down, darling <br />Wear whatever you like{% endraw %}
