{% raw %}(The name &quot;Orishas&quot; refers to the set of deities worshipped in African-based religions in the Americas, like Santería in Cuba and Candomblé in Brazil, resulting from the relocation of Yoruba slaves. These orishas each represent a natural element (such as the ocean or leaves) and exhibit a human characteristic (such as motherhood or love))<br /><br />Los Orishas began as Cuban rap group &quot;Amenaza&quot; in the early 1990s.<br />#PATRIAYVIDA{% endraw %}
