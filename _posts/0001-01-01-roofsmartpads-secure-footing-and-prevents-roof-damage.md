{% raw %}This is what can happen when DON&quot;T use a RoofSmart Pad. <br />RoofSmartPads are patented and made in the USA. <br />Designed to keep the roof worker slipping off the roof and prevents any kind of roof tile from breaking.  Walk on clay, terra cotta, wood, slate, metal, or other fragile roof covering without ever damaging them.  <br />Our special RoofSmartPad ladder brace stops the ladder from slipping or moving. <br />RoofSmartPads will save you money on the very first job you use them. <br />www.roofsmartpad.com{% endraw %}
