{% raw %}A description on how to use a drawing board, sliding ruler and drafting head for beginners.<br />Different brands function in a slightly different manner, but the principles remain the same. The main purpose of a sliding ruler is to draw parallel lines both horizontally and vertically and the purpose of a drafting head is to draw lines at any other angle.<br />Note 1: Try to avoid drawing boards that have drafting heads that do not lock into place at the 30, 45 and 60 degree angles. Those angles are used very frequently and having a drafting head that locks into place helps you to work a lot faster.<br />Note 2: The featured exercise looks easy, because it is in fact easy. Do not skip it. It will help you get used to your drawing board, and it is only with practice that you will become proficient and work as fast as required to finish off tests in time.{% endraw %}
