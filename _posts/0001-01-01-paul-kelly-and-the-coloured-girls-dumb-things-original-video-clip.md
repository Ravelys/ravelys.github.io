At the same time you may also like to explain to the fans why they cannot access this classic material in a decent quality digital format anywhere else?<br /><br />&quot;You won't make a profit on something that cannot be purchased but enough exposure may well help sell what you actually do have for sale. Meanwhile to share ones talents is the greatest of gifts!&quot;<br /><br />Please also be aware that all videos uploaded to YouTube are format shifted by the host website from the original files. This can often cause picture &amp; sound deterioration (i.e. mono audio) as well as the occasional video/audio synchronization issue. The files are also deliberately layered on our end with logos and artists links in order to prevent YouTube recycling by lazy up-loaders, while at the same time helping to promote the artists themselves!<br /><br />Captured &amp; edited @ the VCRS 2008 Â©{% endraw %}
