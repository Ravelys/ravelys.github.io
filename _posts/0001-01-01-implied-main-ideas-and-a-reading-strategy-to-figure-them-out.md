{% raw %}To figure out the implied main idea of a paragraph, use this simple reading strategy. Whether the main idea is stated or implied, the supporting details show patterns of information that help you to understand the main idea.<br /><br />[CC] English | Español | Português.<br /><br />JOIN THIS CHANNEL AND GET ACCESS TO MEMBERSHIP PERKS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/snaplanguage/join">https://www.youtube.com/snaplanguage/join</a> <br /><br />SUPPORT SNAP LANGUAGE<br />To support our work, you can become a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/snaplanguage">https://patreon.com/snaplanguage</a><br /><br />OUR WEBSITE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://snaplanguage.io.">https://snaplanguage.io.</a><br /><br />OUR CHANNELS<br />Snap Language Learner <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/snaplanguagelearner">https://youtube.com/snaplanguagelearner</a><br />Snap Language <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/snaplanguage">https://youtube.com/snaplanguage</a><br /><br />MORE CONTEXT<br />As you read a passage, you must focus on patterns of information. Each sentence in the paragraph gives you new clues as far as what the writer wants you to understand. You get the main points from those ideas or details. These are called the supporting details. If you want to know how to find the main idea in a paragraph, stop looking for that one sentence. Instead, focus on understanding the information the writer put in the paragraph and look for patterns. The main idea of the paragraph will become clear once you start &quot;seeing&quot; those details. This is the main topic of this video.<br />Don't forget that sometimes the writer does not write that one sentence, which we call the main idea sentence in the paragraph because the main idea is clear enough. That's another reason not to spend too much effort looking for that &quot;magic sentence&quot; because it may not be there. It's implied or an implied main idea. That's the main focus of this video.<br /><br />FURTHER READING<br />&quot;Reading Strategy: Figuring out Implied Main Ideas&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/oZjaFJ">http://goo.gl/oZjaFJ</a><br /><br />IN THIS PLAYLIST<br />&quot;Patterns in paragraphs&quot; playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS9dE7WMFmJgeCVVM8RR09gRYS9zgXkVg">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS9dE7WMFmJgeCVVM8RR09gRYS9zgXkVg</a><br /><br />The main idea...  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rfMZkZV9iSk">https://youtu.be/rfMZkZV9iSk</a><br />Supporting details... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hq_719KzR74">https://youtu.be/hq_719KzR74</a><br />Location of the main idea... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/U0yZ8z7lt3Q">https://youtu.be/U0yZ8z7lt3Q</a><br />Implied main ideas...
