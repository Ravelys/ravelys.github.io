{% raw %}Lyrics<br /><br />Forty days and forty nights<br />I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life<br />All the days I waited or you<br />You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you<br /><br />You are out of my league <br />All the things I believe <br />You were just the right kind<br />Yeah, you are more than just a dream<br />You are out of my league<br />Got my heartbeat racing<br />If I die don't wake me<br />'Cause you are more than just a dream<br /><br />From time to time I pinch myself<br />Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else<br />And every time she takes my hand<br />All the wonders that remain become a simple fact<br /><br />You are out of my league <br />All the things I believe <br />You were just the right kind<br />Yeah, you are ore than just a dream<br />You are out of my league<br />Got my heartbeat racing<br />If I die don't wake me<br />'Cause you are more than just a dream<br /><br />You are out of my league <br />All the things I believe <br />You were just the right kind<br />Yeah, you are ore than just a dream<br />You are out of my league<br />Got my heartbeat racing<br />If I die don't wake me<br />'Cause you are more than just a dream{% endraw %}
