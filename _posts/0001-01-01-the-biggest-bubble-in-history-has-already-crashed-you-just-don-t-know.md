Itâ€™s almost old news at this point, Tesla, NIO, Lordstown motors, Nikola, Lucid or CCIV, theyâ€™re all names that youâ€™ve probably heard, and surprisingly enough, for most of those, youâ€™ve probably heard positives and negatives surrounding them. What I can guarantee that you have heard however, is that by and large EV stocks are very valuable right now, and most of this has all really developed over the last year. Some people are claiming that the space is undervalued, that it's the next big sector, that anyone who isnâ€™t throwing their life savings into this space is a dinosaur, but some are saying the opposite. Today, Iâ€™m going to do my best to explain exactly whatâ€™s going on with all these major EV companies, put forward the arguments from both the bulls and the bears, and by the end of the video, hopefully youâ€™ll have learned or gained a new insight, no matter what your opinion might be.  <br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
