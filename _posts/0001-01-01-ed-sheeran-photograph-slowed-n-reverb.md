{% raw %}--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />~lyrics~<br /><br />Loving can hurt<br />Loving can hurt sometimes<br />But it's the only thing that I know<br />When it gets hard<br />You know it can get hard sometimes<br />It is the only thing that makes us feel alive<br /><br />We keep this love in a photograph<br />We made these memories for ourselves<br />Where our eyes are never closing<br />Hearts are never broken<br />Times forever frozen still<br /><br />So you can keep me<br />Inside the pocket<br />Of your ripped jeans<br />Holdin' me closer<br />'Til our eyes meet<br />You won't ever be alone<br />Wait for me to come home<br /><br />Loving can heal<br />Loving can mend your soul<br />And it's the only thing that I know (know)<br />I swear it will get easier<br />Remember that with every piece of ya<br />And it's the only thing we take with us when we die<br /><br />We keep this love in a photograph<br />We made these memories for ourselves<br />Where our eyes are never closing<br />Hearts were never broken<br />Times forever frozen still<br /><br />So you can keep me<br />Inside the pocket<br />Of your ripped jeans<br />Holdin' me closer<br />'Til our eyes meet<br />You won't ever be alone<br /><br />And if you hurt me<br />That's OK, baby, only words bleed<br />Inside these pages you just hold me<br />And I won't ever let you go<br /><br />Wait for me to come home<br />Wait for me to come home<br />Wait for me to come home<br />Wait for me to come home<br /><br />Oh you can fit me<br />Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br />Next to your heartbeat<br />Where I should be<br />Keep it deep within your soul<br /><br />And if you hurt me<br />Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed<br />Inside these pages you just hold me<br />And I won't ever let you go<br /><br />When I'm away<br />I will remember how you kissed me<br />Under the lamppost<br />Back on 6th street<br />Hearing you whisper through the phone<br />&quot;Wait for me to come home&quot;<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />if you liked this (i hope u did!), consider subscribing and turn on notifications for future slowed down songs! you can suggest songs on the comments. credits to the owners of both the song and the image i used.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#slowed #reverb{% endraw %}
