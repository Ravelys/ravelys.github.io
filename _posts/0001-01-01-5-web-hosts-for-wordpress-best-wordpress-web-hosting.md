It's up to you whether or not you want to use this software program, but you need to be aware of its pros and cons. If you think you're up for the task, then make sure that you know what it can do and what it can't. With a little bit of knowledge of the program, you'll have no trouble at all getting yourself a beautiful, functional WordPress blog.<br /><br />One of the biggest disadvantages that one-click installation can give to website owners is that it takes a long time before one's website is live. A person who has to wait a long time before his or her website is live might not have enough patience to wait for the web hosting companies to get around to the maintenance of the site. Of course, those who are online constantly would rather see their one-click installation method work immediately. For these people, the disadvantages of having a WordPress blog could be too much to handle.<br /><br />Many people new to online business think that they are on their own when it comes to web hosting for WordPress. Yes, you certainly will get the advantage of a cheaper monthly fee to maintain your site, but the reliability of this service is on stake. If the web host you use can't make sure that the site will always be online, an online business would probably lose a lot more than a mere flat monthly fee. So, if you're new to online business and web hosting for WordPress, do take note of these disadvantages.<br /><br />Thanks for watching this video on the best 5 web hosts for WordPress.{% endraw %}
