{% raw %}In this animated lecture, I will teach you about electrical energy and electrical energy examples.<br /><br />Q: What is electrical energy?<br />Ans: The most easy definition of electrical energy is &quot; The stored potential and kinetic energy in a charged particle in electric field is called electrical energy. Hence, electrical energy is the stored energy in a charged particles.<br />For example, when you do some sort of work on a point charge and left it up against the electric field of negative charge, that point charge possesses electric potential energy. When this charge falls down or accelerates towards the negative charge its electric potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. We can use the electric potential energy or kinetic energy of the point charge to do different jobs. <br />Remember that when charges flow from one point to other, this movement of charges is called current or electricity.<br /><br />Q: How electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy?<br />Ans: The kinetic energy or the electric potential energy of charges is converted to other forms of energy also known as electrical energy. <br />For example,<br />1) Bulb will convert the kinetic energy of charges to light energy.<br />2) Loud Speaker will convert the kinetic energy of charges to sound energy.<br />3) Electric Heater will convert the kinetic energy of charges to heat energy.<br /><br />To learn more about electrical energy, watch this lecture till the end. <br /><br /><br />#ElectricalEnergy<br />#Physics<br />#NajamAcademy<br /><br />Subscribe my channel at:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Youtube link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Najamacademy/">https://www.facebook.com/Najamacademy/</a>{% endraw %}
