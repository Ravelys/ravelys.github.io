They require hours of work split between a team of two people. The reason we are using a robot voice is that neither I nor my partner are native English speakers and our English speaking ability is sadly not up to standards for this kind of videos. We do understand there is a lot more potential for this content so we are looking to hire a professional voice over artist as soon as we get the budget for it. But until then these are all the programs we use to create these videos: Adobe premiere pro for video creation, Adobe photoshop for thumbnail creation, and to create a voice we use a program called balabolka.{% endraw %}
