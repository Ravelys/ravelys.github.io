{% raw %}When Jackie Warren's husband goes through a mid-life crisis and announces that he is having an affair, she decides to make a new life for herself. Once a wealthy socialite, she enters the work force for the first time and gets her own place to live. Jackie squeezes into a less-than-lavish but charming house owned by former football player Marion Hill, whose stellar career was ruined by a freak accident. To cover expenses while he trains for a comeback, he moves into the apartment above his garage and rents his main house to Jackie and her two children. The kitchen becomes common ground for the tenants and their landlord. With only two years of law school as her experience, Jackie is hired as a legal assistant by Heather Comstock, a young no-nonsense power attorney. While she's working, Jackie must find someone to take care of her children. Despite her misgivings about Marion, Jackie's overly dramatic teenaged daughter Tiffany and her brainy young son Austin convince her to give him a chance.{% endraw %}
