{% raw %}Nurture or nature? What makes us our most unique and authentic selves? In her talk, Margot Amoyual meshes personal anecdotes with world observations to provide an understanding of individuality and identity from the perspective of an identical twin.  Margot is a senior at Beaver Country Day School. When she is not spending time with her twin, Ella, Margot loves learning about neuroscience, writing for her high school satirical magazine, playing jazz piano, listening to podcasts, reading, and walking dogs. When she grows up, she hopes to attend the Twinsburg Twins Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
