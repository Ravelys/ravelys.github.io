Today we are going to learn a bit more about healthy eating, something very important to all of us. We already know that healthy foods are fundamental for our existence, they help us to grow, be strong and be healthy! To eat healthily, one must learn about the variety and quantities of the food we eat. We need to learn about the food pyramid and follow its steps!<br />Here it is:<br />The first step on the pyramid, the smallest one, is the one about fats and sweets. It is the favoured one by all children, but to be honest, it is the worst one. One must eat very little or nothing from this step. Pastry’s and sweeties are delicious but they contain a high number of calories, which are very bad for our body. They make us fatter and don’t help with anything. In fact, many doctors agree that this sector is very bad for our health!<br />The second step is formed by meat, fish and eggs. It is very important to vary these foods every day. You shouldn’t just eat meat because you don’t like fish. In fact, we should eat more fish and eggs than meat!<br />The third step is all about dairy. This group consists of milk, cheese and butter. I especially love yoghurts. We must eat these foods from one to three times a day!<br />The fourth step is extremely important because it evolves around fruits and vegetables. These foods fill our bodies with vitamins and minerals and allow us to stay in shape and be strong. Doctors recommend to eat these 5 times a day, if you do your body will thank you!<br />The base of the pyramid, the fifth step, is the group of the carbohydrates. Here you can find cereals, bread, pasta rice and potatoes. They are also very important so we must eat them daily.<br />As well as following the different steps in the pyramid, we need to take into account the advice of doctors and nutrition experts. One must try to eat at the same time every day, eating with family will always be beneficial, and also drink plenty of water! But most importantly, every day we must do some kind of physical exercise. <br />If we eat healthy and do exercise we will grow strong both mentally and physically! So now you know!{% endraw %}
