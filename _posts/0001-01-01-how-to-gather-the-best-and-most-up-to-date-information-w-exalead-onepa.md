{% raw %}I'm a facility manager in charge of two sites in the US and France. I received an incident report on the air conditioning in Room 1185, so I need to send someone to solve the problem. To meet my margin objectives, I need to send the technician only one time and make sure he's successful the first time. Let's use OnePart to gather the best and most up-to-date information and share it with the work order of the technician.<br />Because it's urgent, I must be able to do it in only 2 minutes!{% endraw %}
