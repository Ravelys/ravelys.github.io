{% raw %}Let's talk about how arguments work!  <br /><br />Argument is when an author wants to convince you of their position. “This is my position; you should share this position, and here is why.” Argument does not sneak. It does not come in through the back. It is supported by reasons, evidence, examples. Not just pure opinion, not just cherry-picked stories. Data! Fact! Observable reality.<br /><br />Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization with the mission of providing a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. We offer quizzes, questions, instructional videos, and articles on a range of academic subjects, including math, biology, chemistry, physics, history, economics, finance, grammar, preschool learning, and more. We provide teachers with tools and data so they can help their students develop the skills, habits, and mindsets for success in school and beyond. Khan Academy has been translated into dozens of languages, and 15 million people around the globe learn on Khan Academy every month.
