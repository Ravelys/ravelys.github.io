{% raw %}This video of the song “Hold Forth the Light” was recorded live at The Way Ministry’s 76th Anniversary Sunday Teaching Service (October 7, 2018).<br /><br />God has given His people the joy and privilege to reconcile others back to Him by speaking His Word. This song describes the change in someone’s life when they received answers of truth and peace from a believer willing to speak God’s Word. Once your life has been changed by the light of God’s Word, you can hold forth that light to others in need.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Watch our playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3A63pN5wmzGpSzoQLtb_tmIhG5fyEU6">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp3A63pN5wmzGpSzoQLtb_tmIhG5fyEU6</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Music has been a rich part of the history of The Way International since its founding in 1942.
