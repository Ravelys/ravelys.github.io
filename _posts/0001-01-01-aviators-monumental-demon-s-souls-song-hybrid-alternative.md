To kick off the preorder, here is my tribute to the Maiden in Black from Demon's Souls, and her quest to lull an ancient demon back to sleep. The music is a strange mix of Orchestral EDM and Alt Rock I've never really done before, taking the themes of DeS into a different soundscape than its own soundtrack. It's the third single of many more to come from the new album!<br /><br />Instrumental Version:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3iaag471j2q3jlp/Instrumonumental.wav?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/3iaag471j2q3jlp/Instrumonumental.wav?dl=0</a><br /><br />Vocal Stem for Remixes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwt7r1x4vtzbj57/Monumental%20Vocal%20Stem.wav?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/hwt7r1x4vtzbj57/Monumental%20Vocal%20Stem.wav?dl=0</a><br /><br />For more music or to get in touch, find me on<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Aviators">https://www.patreon.com/Aviators</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Aviators84">https://twitter.com/Aviators84</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/aviatorslivestream">https://www.twitch.tv/aviatorslivestream</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/JWqXshB">https://discord.gg/JWqXshB</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Awake inside the nexus of the earth <br />A place of comfort, for spirits' birth<br />Your essence held, in my unbroken hands<br />A shadow lost to foiled plans<br />In the peak of the night<br />I will set you free<br />Now you're a ghost in the light<br />With the brand that we<br />Hold inside our hearts<br />Death's own counterpart<br />Respite from the reaper's lie<br /><br />So may your dreams be monumental<br />When your spirit guides the way<br />Within the flicker of a candle<br />I will heal your soul's decay<br />We share a fate<br />Trapped on a page<br />By the author of our world's demise<br />In your eyes<br />I see the pain<br />Your targets slain<br />I will be the whispers in your mind<br />The demon inside<br /><br />A dark embrace, the keeper of the lost<br />For this old city's unyielding cost<br />So take my hand and grow within my power<br />Oh, slayer of kings, let this demon devour<br />In the black of the night<br />You have been set free<br />Now you're a ghost in the light<br />With a purpose we<br />Know inside our hearts<br />Death's own counterpart<br />Respite from the reaper's lie<br /><br />Strengthen your desire<br />Consume the hellfire<br />Don't let down your guard<br />Let in the darkness<br />You will defeat this<br />Trial of ancient gods<br />Take me in spirit<br />Demon adherent<br />When you're the last one to survive<br />Spirit, stay gentle<br />Next monumental<br />Will you keep the fire alive?<br /><br />I, with the power inside set an end to these<br />Lies, from the deep and the quiet, set the whispers free<br />Sleep, my old enemy<br />Let come an end to me<br />Traveler, please let me fade<br />Here, at the end of the line all has been returned<br />Leave, from the land of the dead, and the souls upturned<br />Please, child, remember me<br />Lost in a memory<br />Let this demon rot away{% endraw %}
