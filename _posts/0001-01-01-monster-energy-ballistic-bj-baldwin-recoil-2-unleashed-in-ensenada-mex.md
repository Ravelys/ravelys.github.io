{% raw %}What better place than the city streets of Ensenada Mexico, the home of the Baja 1000, to set the stage for the sequel to Ballistic BJ Baldwin's viral hit Recoil. This short film by Monster Energy follows BJ and his 800hp Trophy Truck as he tears through this seaside Mexican city, ripping over every drop and jump the town has to offer in an attempt to win a bet set by his friend, and international playboy Dan Bilzerian. Will he win? What will he lose? <br /><br />RECOIL 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/Mmh-ew1swD4">http://youtu.be/Mmh-ew1swD4</a><br /><br />Filmed by Logan and Sons.<br /><br />Follow Monster Energy:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/MonsterEnergy">http://www.facebook.com/MonsterEnergy</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/MonsterEnergy">http://www.twitter.com/MonsterEnergy</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/MonsterEnergy">http://www.instagram.com/MonsterEnergy</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.MonsterEnergy.com">http://www.MonsterEnergy.com</a>{% endraw %}
