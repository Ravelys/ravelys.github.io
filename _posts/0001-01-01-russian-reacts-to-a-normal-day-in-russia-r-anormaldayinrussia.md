{% raw %}SUPPORT ME ON PATREON: ​<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/nfkrz">https://www.patreon.com/nfkrz</a><br />I've seen a lot of videos of people reacting to the A Normal Day in Russia subreddit (r/anormaldayinrussia), which features somee of the strangest and funniest videos from Russia you can find on the internet. I decided that being Russian myself it would be only right for me to do a reaction to the subreddit as well. I have high hopes for you, A Normal Day in Russia: you better not disappoint.
