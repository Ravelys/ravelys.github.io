{% raw %}In this video I try the new Phasmophobia Nightmare Difficulty for the very first time! Nightmare mode is CRAZY, this is actually a super hard challenge. This will put everything you know about Phasmophobia to the test! I can't wait to make a bunch of nightmare difficulty guides in the future! It will be awesome! I hope you enjoyed my first experience with the new difficulty. Much love and see you during the streams :D<br /><br />I stream every day on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/insym">https://www.twitch.tv/insym</a><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/InsymTtv">https://twitter.com/InsymTtv</a><br />Join the community discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/insym">https://discord.gg/insym</a><br /><br />NOTE: This video was recorded on Phasmophobia update v0.4.0{% endraw %}
