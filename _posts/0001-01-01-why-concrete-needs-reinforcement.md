{% raw %}More destructive testing to answer your questions about concrete.<br /><br />Concrete's greatest weakness is its tensile strength, which can be less than 10% of its compressive strength. So, we often reinforce it to create a composite material strong against all types of stress. This video briefly touches on conventional rebar and prestressed/post-tensioned reinforcement.<br /><br />-Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/PracticalEngineering">http://patreon.com/PracticalEngineering</a><br />-Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://practical.engineering">http://practical.engineering</a><br /><br />Marxist Arrow by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License<br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBlLC8TUXP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBlLC8TUXP0</a><br /><br />Tonic and Energy by Elexive is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License<br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fBPdu8w9U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6fBPdu8w9U</a><br /><br />This video was sponsored by Skillshare.{% endraw %}
