I think technology is cool. With all of the information we have we can learn to create whatever we want. I love watching youtube videos of new inventions and technology but I can't really participate in that world, only observe. I found out when I was young that I am much more creative than anything. I love being creative and pursuing art so I am happy, but still can't help but to be dazzled by the science world. I love thinking of invention ideas though. I often day dream invention ideas with absolute no regard to if it could actually work. It's just for fun and a good way for me to kill time/procrastinate. <br /><br /><br />This video was made in kind of a sloppy way but honestly I think it might be my best I've made yet? Regarding jokes at least I feel I did pretty good. I have a problem where I ramble on when I tell stories in other videos, and I think I went the other direction in this video where I did less rambling and more funny honk honk. Hopefully It didn't come off as to directionless though. I showed some of my friends and they seemed to like it. hope everyone else does too :)<br /><br />This video was just prompted by day dreaming. It's more stream-of-consciousness rather than a big story. I kind of liked doing that because it gave me a little more wiggle room to be creative in a different way. I might try that out a bit more. just short goofy stuff. I hope you don't mind that it's shorter. I felt if I tried to make it longer it would just end up being rambling. Short and sweet is what I was trying to go for. <br /><br />I have another video I'm already working on that will come out really soon. I am pretty pumped about that. I am bad at upload schedule and uploading in quick succession is something I'm excited about.<br /><br />Stay safe ‚ù§Ô∏è see you next video.<br /><br /><br />üëï merch:<br />[updating merch i'll add a link later]<br /><br /><br /><br />üì± twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy">https://twitter.com/ICSandwichGuy</a><br /><br />üì∑ instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/">https://www.instagram.com/icecreamsandwichguy/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Ice Cream Sandwich content is inappropriate for children under 13 years old.
