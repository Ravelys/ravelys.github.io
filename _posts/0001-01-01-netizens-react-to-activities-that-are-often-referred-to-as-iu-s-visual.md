{% raw %}Hello everyone~ <br />Thank you for watching! <br /><br />Which era was your favorite? I can't decide because I love them all! Let me know in the comments below.<br /><br />About my channel:<br />I translate online community forum posts written by Korean netizens as well as their reactions. There probably won’t be any news article translations on here since I can’t keep up with it all. But my videos are hot and trending topics, so they’re all interesting to check out. You might learn a new thing or two about K-Pop idols, Korean actors, entertainment world, and life in South Korea in general.{% endraw %}
