{% raw %}We were literally speechless after riding the S-Works Turbo Creo SL and Specialized Turbo Creo Comp Carbon crafted by geniuses that developed the Tarmac, Venge and Diverge — #specialized. We can tell that they have all the needs (and even wants) of different riders in mind while creating these rad rides and boy they are tough to top!<br /><br />Here’s is our initial review and we can’t wait to hit the climbs and take them with us in an unforgettable adventure. <br /><br />We’d like to thank Kalif of Specialized Malaysia for reaching out to us and for making this dream collaboration happen and of course to Ritchie of Specialized PH for sharing what these bikes have to offer with much gusto and for personally handing these bikes over to us!<br /><br />To know more about the S-Works Turbo Creo SL and Specialized Turbo Creo Comp Carbon, just visit the official social media channels of Specialized PH.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://specialized.com.ph/">https://specialized.com.ph/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/specialized.ph">https://www.facebook.com/specialized.ph</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/specialized_ph/">https://www.instagram.com/specialized_ph/</a><br /><br />#iamspecialized #ebike #gravelbike #nevernotriding <br /><br /><br />Stay updated by following us on:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/leviandsaracycle/">https://www.instagram.com/leviandsaracycle/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/leviandsaracycle/">https://www.facebook.com/leviandsaracycle/</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@leviandsaracycle">https://www.tiktok.com/@leviandsaracycle</a><br /><br /><br />Hello, Darlings! We are Levi and Sara, a #pride couple since 2011 who loves to discover unique places and meet different kinds of people by just using our bikes. Our passion started in 2017 in Japan where used city bikes to commute. This gave us an idea to also do the same back home. But the short city rides in our foldies turned into longer journeys going to different towns and it eventually became our lifestyle. We wish to inspire more people to get on their saddles, get moving and ALWAYS ENJOY THE RIDE!{% endraw %}
