Here're the indicator pairs I recommend for trading penny stock breakouts and large caps. <br />üîΩTime stamps:<br />1:41 Using MACD and RSI indicator for trend reversals &amp; finding entries<br />4:13 Tax breaks &amp; wash sale rule for investor traders<br />10:00 Why I do NOT rely on indicators when day trading<br /><br />I do not recommend relying on indicators when day trading. But for day trading beginners who are getting started and new to the stock market, here are some indicator pairs I personally found useful when finding entries and exits in day trading.<br /><br />1. MACD and RSI indicator pair<br />MACD is a trend indicator, while RSI tells you the strength or weakness of a stock. MACD tends to be a lagging indicator, while RSI is early. <br />So when put together, RSI signals potential reversal coming soon, but MACD allows you to stay in the trade until reversal has confirmed. And indicates entries for you to add. <br /><br />2. VWAP and 9 Exponential moving average pair<br />VWAP stands for volume weighted average price, it signals the short term sentiment of a stock whether it's bullish or bearish. When putting VWAP and 9 EMA together, this pair signals a strong breakout in both penny stocks and large caps. 9 EMA acts as potential entry once that breakout as occured. <br /><br />üñ•Ô∏èMy Stock Scanners &amp; News feed:<br />Benzinga Pro FREE 14 day trial (use code &quot;HUMBLEDTRADER&quot; to get 25% Off )<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2KXeAqH">http://bit.ly/2KXeAqH</a><br />Trade Ideas Scanner (use code &quot;HUMBLED15&quot; to get 15% Off)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rLAfp2">https://bit.ly/3rLAfp2</a><br />Premium Thinkorswim indicators (use code &quot;HUMBLED10&quot; to get 10% OFF)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Rno2Gh">https://bit.ly/2Rno2Gh</a><br /><br />üìâMy Trading Broker Platforms:<br />Cobra Trading (Best broker for shorting stocks, $30K min)<br />Get 25% off commissions, mention &quot;Humbled Trader&quot; at the time of account opening<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3iNLqJq">https://bit.ly/3iNLqJq</a><br /><br />Interactive Brokers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2xNpQ5o">https://bit.ly/2xNpQ5o</a><br />üá®üá¶Questrade Canada (get $50 FREE commission trades)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2GoeUMY">http://bit.ly/2GoeUMY</a><br />Webull Free Trading app (Get free stocks with $100 deposit)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Lhtd9X">http://bit.ly/2Lhtd9X</a><br /><br />Get My Trading Station Set Up &amp; Favorite Trading Books<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/humbledtrader">https://www.amazon.com/shop/humbledtrader</a><br /><br />‚úÖMy REAL Social Accounts:<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/humbledtrader/">https://www.instagram.com/humbledtrader/</a><br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HumbledTrader">https://www.facebook.com/HumbledTrader</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HumbledTrader18">https://twitter.com/HumbledTrader18</a><br />#daytrading #pennystocks #stocks<br />___<br />DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial adviser nor a CPA.
