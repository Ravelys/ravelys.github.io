Also, I briefly talked about different types of diagrams that BAs can use to analyze and define these different types of requirements as well. Let me know if you have any questions in the comments below. <br /><br />Happy BA learning! <br /><br />Source Credits:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.learningtree.com/the-babok-requirements-taxonomy/">https://blog.learningtree.com/the-babok-requirements-taxonomy/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.corpedgroup.com/resources/ba/Requirements-Classification-Diagram.pdf">https://www.corpedgroup.com/resources/ba/Requirements-Classification-Diagram.pdf</a>{% endraw %}
