{% raw %}97% Owned: The Cruel Truth Behind Money Credit and Financial Crisis | Business Documentary from 2012<br /><br />When money drives almost all activity on the planet, it’s essential that we understand it.  The documentary 97% Owned aims to answer questions like: Where does the money come from? Who creates it? Who decides how it gets used? And what does that mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when money and finance break down?<br />97% Owned reveals how the creation of credit and the mystery that surrounds it. The documentary goes at the root of our current social and economic crisis. Referring to the 97% of the world’s money supply that is represented by credit, this thought-provoking film presents serious research and verifiable evidence on our economic and financial system. Featuring frank interviews and commentary from economists, campaigners and former bankers, it exposes the privatized, debt-based monetary system that gives banks the power to create money, shape the economy, cause crises and push house prices out of reach. Fact-based and clearly explained, 97% Owned demonstrates how the power to create money is the piece of the puzzle that economists were missing when they failed to predict the crisis.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Subscribe ENDEVR for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG">https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG</a><br />Join the club and become a Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary">https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/">https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #97%Owned<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />ENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainer videos and animations.
