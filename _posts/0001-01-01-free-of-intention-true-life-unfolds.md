{% raw %}Free from intentions, desires, and obsessive planning, we are back in our natural state which is spontaneous and in harmony with all of life. <br /><br />&quot;Intention creates inner-tension. <br /><br />Before you pick up something, what are you? Are you incomplete?<br /><br />When you are aware of yourself beyond the functioning of the instrumental self, you are in your openness, you are in your God field.&quot; <br /><br />-<br /><br />If you would like to support the sharing of Satsang, you can donate here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7">https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
