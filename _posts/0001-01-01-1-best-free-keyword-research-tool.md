So I've got a few examples down here and we're gonna start with best kitchen knife. <br /><br />Now this is, you know, if I'm doing a, an affiliate blog, if I'm a mom blogger who does a lot about cooking and recipes, this is where I'm going to go.<br /><br />This is that next video that I'm talking about. I've got five separate keyword suggestion tools that blow the doors off of this. Um, it's probably good to just sign in and get it since you're using this tool, but be sure to subscribe so you get that next video. Now, the first thing you see right up top is a search volume. Though. The reason you want to pay attention to the search volume when you're doing content marketing is if you title your blog, posts your videos correctly, they're going to be in alignment with what people are searching. If you title them incorrectly, that means no one's gonna be able to find what you're doing because you simply chose the phrase that no one's actually searching. So that's the first metric we're paying attention to here is what is the actual search volume and then there's the S E O difficulty.<br /><br />Now the SEO difficulty is an organic number. The pay difficulty is obviously paper click. This is obviously the cost per click and the SEO difficulty is the other factor that you want to keep in mind. So you're always playing a little bit of a mental balance game. You want high search volume, but you also want low keyword difficulty or low SEO difficulty as he calls it here. And then he gives you a little heads up that the average page ranks has 51 backlinks and a domain score of 79 now he doesn't exactly say how he calculates the difficulty and the domain score, which is one of my challenges and why the paid premium tool that I still personally use. They give me more insight so I can get a little bit more surgical with my data to know what I need to do to overtake the competition.<br /><br />But this is great if you're on a budget, if you don't have 50 bucks a month to invest in a proper tool, this is a great place to go. Now we searched down in the bottom and you're going to see he has additional keywords suggested here, but they're all extremely similar and that's one of the flaws of this tool is how similar they are. Now you notice right here on keyword ideas, these tabs on the right will actually bring you more keyword suggestions. So I just went from suggestions to related and they're still very similar. Okay, we get best kitchen knife sharpener at this point, but then we can get into the questions and these questions are related to the best kitchen knife. So who makes the best kitchen knives? But if you notice the keyword volume, we're down pretty low at this point for still having a relatively high SEO difficulty score.{% endraw %}
