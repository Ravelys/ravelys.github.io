What do I stand for?<br />Most nights, I don't know anymore...<br />oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh<br />oh woah, oh woah, oh woah oh oh<br /><br />This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?<br />Why don't we break the rules already?<br />I was never one to believe the hype - save that for the black and white<br />I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked, but here they come again to jack my style<br /><br />And that's alright; I found a martyr in my bed tonight<br />She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am<br />Oh, who am I? Oh, who am I? mmm... mmm...<br /><br />Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end<br />Cause I could use some friends for a change<br />And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again<br />Some nights, I always win, I always win...<br /><br />But I still wake up, I still see your ghost<br />Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh<br />What do I stand for? What do I stand for?<br />Most nights, I don't know... (come on)<br /><br />So this is it? I sold my soul for this?<br />Washed my hands of that for this?<br />I miss my mom and dad for this?<br /><br />No. When I see stars, when I see, when I see stars, that's all they are<br />When I hear songs, they sound like this one, so come on<br />Oh, come on. Oh, come on, OH COME ON!<br /><br />Well, this is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again<br />Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands<br />This one is not for the folks at home; Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go<br />Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?<br /><br />My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she call &quot;love&quot;<br />But when I look into my nephew's eyes...<br />Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...<br />Some terrible nights...ahhh...<br /><br />oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh<br />oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh oh<br /><br />The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me<br />I called you up, but we'd both agree<br />It's for the best you didn't listen<br />It's for the best we get our distance... oh...<br />It's for the best you didn't listen<br />It's for the best we get our distance... oh...{% endraw %}
