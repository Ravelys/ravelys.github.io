{% raw %}The Kia e-Niro has reached the end of the lease (ðŸ˜­) so we needed to get a car to tide us over until the next proper Till family EV arrives. Enter Onto! A great way of testing a car for a month (or more) and if you get it though your business, it's almost completely tax free.<br /><br />It's not cheap, but it's inclusive of insurance and tax and there's even free charging with Shell and BP so it's not too bad a deal.<br /><br />In this video I talk about the order process, show the delivery and a quick walk around of the car we got: a brand, spanking new DS 3 Crossback E-tense.<br /><br />This is the first of an absolute torrent of videos that will be coming by the way: installing a Zappi charger, giving back the e-Niro, getting a second-hand car in auction and much more â€” so do subscribe and press that bell icon!<br /><br />My Onto referral code to get Â£50 off for us both: 31af4<br /><br />Tweet me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tillathenun">https://twitter.com/tillathenun</a>{% endraw %}
