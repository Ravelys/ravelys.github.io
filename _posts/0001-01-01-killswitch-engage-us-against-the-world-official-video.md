{% raw %}&quot;Us Against the World&quot; from &quot;Atonement.&quot; Listen/buy here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kse.lnk.to/atonement">https://kse.lnk.to/atonement</a><br />&quot;This is one of my favorite songs off the album so I'm glad it is getting some attention and a visual component. It's a song about facing down the odds and finding confidence to overcome and conquer a situation. I originally wrote it as a battle cry song with my warrior Highland Scottish, Norwegian, and Swedish ancestors in mind. However, it can be about friendship, love, or even the camaraderie of being in a band traveling the world. The title says it all â€” 'Us Against The World!'&quot; - Jesse Leach<br /><br />Directed by David Brodsky and Allison Woest for MyGoodEye.<br /><br /><br />#killswitchengage #atonement #usagainsttheworld{% endraw %}
