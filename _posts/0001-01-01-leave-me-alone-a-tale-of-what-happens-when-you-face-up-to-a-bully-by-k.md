But the little boy also has friends. A frog, a cat, a rabbit, a cow, and other animal friends insist on helping him, even after he tells them: &quot;There's nothing you can do for me/ There's nothing you can say.&quot; Fortunately, he is mistaken, because the next time the bully approaches, they all join with him and shout, &quot;LEAVE HIM ALONE!&quot; And it works! The bully turns around and goes away.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Children Children's Kids Kid's story stories read aloud{% endraw %}
