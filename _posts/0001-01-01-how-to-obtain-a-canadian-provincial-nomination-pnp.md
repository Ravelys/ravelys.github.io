{% raw %}Are you looking to obtain a provincial nomination (PNP) to increase your #ExpressEntry CRS score, or as your way into Canada? We explain how to obtain one!<br /><br />#canadavisa #canadapr #immigratetocanada #expressentrycanada<br /><br />In this video we will explain how to obtain a provincial nomination without a job offer, as well as which provinces will consider applicants without a job offer. <br /><br />When seeking to immigrate to Canada there are various programs available depending on your age, level of education, work experience, employment offers and language abilities.<br /><br />Canada divides their immigration programs into Federal programs and Provincial programs.<br /><br />Federal programs are run by the Canadian Federal Government and allow an individual to live and work anywhere in Canada, with the exception of Quebec as they have their own immigration programs. Provincial programs are run by each province/territory individually and are tailored to their specific needs. These programs were created to allow the provinces to bring in new immigrants to fit their needs.<br /><br />For applicants in the Express Entry system, a provincial nomination can add 600 points to their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score.{% endraw %}
