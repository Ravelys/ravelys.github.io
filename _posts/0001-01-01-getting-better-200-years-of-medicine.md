{% raw %}Getting Better is a short documentary that explores three remarkable stories of medical progress:  Cancer, HIV/AIDS, Surgery.  The film looks at the role of researchers and clinicians, of patients, their families and their advocates, and how information is translated into action.  It is the story of research, clinical practice and patient care, and how we have continued to get better over the last 200 years.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 2012 the New England Journal of Medicine celebrates 200 years of publishing practice - changing medical advances.  NEJM brings together a global community, from researchers to clinicians, to improve the health of people around the world.  The 200th anniversary of NEJM honors all who contribute to this mission.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nejm200.nejm.org">http://nejm200.nejm.org</a>{% endraw %}
