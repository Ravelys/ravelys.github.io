{% raw %}PG rated <br />this video contains graphic content. Inappropriate language, rude humour and grown men being bent over. Please bugger off if this content is to heinous for your liking. <br /><br />Kia Ora whanau this is our latest action packed trip to the Three king’s islands, 55 kilometres (34 mi) northwest of Cape Reinga, New Zealand.<br />This footage is filmed across the 5 day period with nothing but bent rods, beer bottles and some keen anglers putting there body’s to the test. For everyone who has been up to this magical place you will relive the pain through this video and for the people who haven’t been this is what you could possibly be in for if you ever go up. Would like to thank the boys at Enchanted charters for looking after us.{% endraw %}
