{% raw %}A volunteer group operating within the night-time industry say they 'have to concede' that a ticketing system was being implemented.<br /><br />Sunil Sharpe from Give Us The Night says this is the final decision.<br /><br />He was speaking as tickets into nightclubs and late bars will have to be booked at least an hour in advance.<br /><br />Government officials have told representatives of the hospitality sector at a meeting that all tickets will have to be digital.<br /><br />Congregation outside of clubs will be prohibited, with only ticket holders allowed to queue up.<br /><br />Some uncertainty remains about the exact details of some of the new measures.<br /><br />Sunil told Lunchtime Live the issue around ticketing has been debated back and forth.<br /><br />&quot;This conversation was first started during last week - I think it first came up on Wednesday, it was on the table then, then it was off the table, then it was back again Thursday, then it was gone again.<br /><br />&quot;Then there was silence from the departments throughout Friday until later that evening.<br /><br />&quot;We met [with] I think 15 or 20 minutes notice, and we were told that ticketing would be coming into place.&quot;<br /><br />He says this is looking like a final decision, but they are hopeful of a review soon.<br /><br />&quot;We're at this point now where I kind of have to concede that it's coming in.<br /><br />&quot;I think none of us want it to come in, but it appears like this is the final decision now.<br /><br />&quot;So it's really about how that change actually looks, and how much it actually will affect the industry from here on in.<br /><br />&quot;It's about damage limitation, really, with this restriction - and how long it remains in place.<br /><br />&quot;We need to know that there will be a prompt review of this, hopefully within a couple of weeks&quot;.{% endraw %}
