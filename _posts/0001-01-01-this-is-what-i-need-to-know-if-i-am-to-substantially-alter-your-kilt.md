{% raw %}Do you need me to alter your kilt, yet you are unable to personally visit my shop in Vancouver? <br /><br />I've been thinking about how I might offer the personal attention to detail that is central to Bespoke tailoring to those who are unable to visit my shop. <br /><br />If you send me the information that I ask for in this video I should be able to tell you what may be achieved and at what cost, without having you bear the expense and bother of sending me the kilt only to have me decide that it's beyond my ability and then returning it to you.<br /><br />A properly-make kilt is very nearly always alterable (is that a word?) and although I promise my best service when you are physically in my shop, this method should satisfy very nearly as well.{% endraw %}
