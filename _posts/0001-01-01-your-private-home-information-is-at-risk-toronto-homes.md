{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.primetorontoneighbourhoods.com/contact/">http://www.primetorontoneighbourhoods.com/contact/</a>   Competition Bureau chief Melanie Aitken wants to get rid of everything that's private information about your home.<br /><br />It appears that this tireless warrior won't stop at anything until she is done modelling the real estate industry to her liking. <br /><br />In many cases there is little if any evidence that she speaks on behalf of the public majority about buying and selling homes.<br /><br />Most of the changes she has demanded have been adopted by TREB and the Canadian Real Estate industry. <br /><br />The most recent change implemented by the real estate industry, allowed any homeowner access to the MLS system, without having to pay a listing agent a fee in the event of the sale of that home.<br /><br />Her latest mission to save Canadian consumers from the real estate industry is not only unreasonable but of questionable legality.<br /><br />Not long ago, real estate consumers spoke with a single voice about wanting to keep all information regarding the sale price of their homes private. <br /><br />Those requests were turned into law and are found in the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA for short.<br /><br />Ms Aitken appears to want to ignore such law and make all home sale price information available to anyone with internet access.<br /><br />We believe Ms. Aitken is on the wrong side of the issue and the real estate industry has not accepted her order to change the current situation.<br /><br />If this issue remains unresolved, Ms. Aitken's only alternative appears destined for a hearing at the Competition Tribunal, which has the power to impose a ruling or drop the case.{% endraw %}
