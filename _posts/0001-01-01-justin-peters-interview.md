{% raw %}This past week, I had the honor and privilege of interviewing Justin Peters. Justin began the interview by talking about his work and ministry. He also provided a summary of his personal testimony. Then Justin described the Word of Faith movement, explained its major tenets and characteristics and who some of its leading teachers and proponents are. He provided guidance for believers on how to correctly respond to faulty Faith argumentation and what to do to help friends and family members who are still trapped in the movement. Justin likewise provided a description and critique of the rising social j*stice movement within Big Eva. He concluded the interview by naming some solid Bible teachers and pastors who Christians can trust. I hope you enjoy this interview with Justin. He is one of the most solid Bible teachers in the church today and I hope that his keen insights and his vast array of biblical knowledge can provide you with help, strength and encouragement.{% endraw %}
