{% raw %}In this video i provide a comprehensive side by side comparison of the Wide Range humbuckers from  Squier, Creamery and Catwhisker pickups.<br /><br />The amp used was an old school 90s solid state Fender Princeton which provided the clean and Dirt channel. The Fuzz pedal was Hudson Broadcast.  The pedal that makes the weird noise is a DBA Robot.  Oh in case you were wondering I had to sit down throughout this as Iâ€™d damaged my leg :(<br /><br />Start 00:00<br />Intro 00:17<br />Clean 02:37<br />Dirt 06:11<br />Fuzz 09:49<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.creamery-pickups.co.uk">https://www.creamery-pickups.co.uk</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mojopickups.co.uk">https://www.mojopickups.co.uk</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.catswhiskerpickups.co.uk">http://www.catswhiskerpickups.co.uk</a><br /><br />#Widerangehumbucker #jazzblaster #guitar{% endraw %}
