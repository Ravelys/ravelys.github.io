So lets tackle the why first.<br /><br />Why:<br />- I want a deep intimate knowledge of where my money is going, because if I know where my money is going we can accomplish a few things:<br />- Being conscious of spending<br />- Not making senseless purchases that I’ll regret later, every purchase has more consideration<br />When you’re inputting everything in, it is bringing more awareness to your spending and thus your money is more purposeful<br /><br />Identifying Trends<br />- By building a long running history of my tracked expenses, I can tell when my spending might start getting out of hand, this especially guards against lifestyle inflation – for those of you who do know what that is, it’s basically when you start making more money, you feel like you can spend more money – and often times people start to spend more as a result of it. <br /><br />Maximizing Budget<br />- By not making senseless purchases, I’m able to budget more money into doing the things I actually want to do: treating myself to dinner out, going to a concert, travel, etc.<br />- I’m also able to understand what I spend on a monthly basis and am then able to make adjustments into how much I spend on different categories to hit my spending and savings goals.<br /><br />How:<br />1. Remove Your Ego<br />- It's the #1 reason why people stop tracking, it's embarrassing to face our purchasing decisions.<br />2. Enter Expenses Immediately<br />- Easy to do, won't forget it.<br />3. Separate your Monthly and Discretionary Expenses<br />- Good to know how much your monthly recurring expenses total number is<br />4. Reward Yourself<br />- Or else how are you gonna keep going?<br />5. Summarize and Analyze<br />- Identify the trends, fix the leaks, and manage your money better!<br /><br />My last caveat is that, one time purchases, especially large ones, I like to enter in on my spreadsheet as a separate line. It feels bad to enter it in to my monthly running total of discretionary expenses, and to avoid that – if I do have a one-time big purchase, it will be reflected in my spreadsheet later on.<br /><br />👊 If you like the work and appreciate the value it may bring, please show it some love and drop me a Like and a Comment (I reply to every single one!).
