{% raw %}Heavy snowstorm in the cold mountains of Ukraine. Imagine you lying in bed under a thick warm blanket listening to the icy howling wind and falling snow on the roof. No noises from people talking and heavy traffic keeping you awake. These howling wind sounds are the best background sounds for sleeping, relaxing and studying. We hope you enjoy this calming winter ambience! Good sleep!!<br /><br /><br /> â—¼ All my soundscape videos are made in high quality with editing programs such as Vegas Pro, Photoshop and Audacity, and take many hours / days of editing and mixing to create. The equipment I use to record the audio are the Zoom H5 or H6 recorder + Audio-Technica BP4025 microphone, and for the videos I use the GoPro Hero6. Some video and audio files are made in collaboration with other video / audio creators with all the licenses &amp; commercial use rights that are necessary. I mixed these video or audio files with the creation of myself. Sometimes I use a photo and make a moving video of it. <br />See this photo as an example: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pixabay.com/nl/photos/sneeuw-sunrise-boom-park-winter-2010710/">https://pixabay.com/nl/photos/sneeuw-sunrise-boom-park-winter-2010710/</a>  <br />Watch the video I made of this photo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0VaEIEO6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0VaEIEO6U</a><br />I hope you like my channel!
