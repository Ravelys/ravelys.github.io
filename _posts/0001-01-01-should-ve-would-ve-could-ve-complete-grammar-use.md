I have launched my British English (Modern RP) pronunciation course! I’ll train you to read phonetic transcriptions, and produce each sound that comprises modern received pronunciation. I’ll also teach you how to implement the correct use of intonation, stress, rhythm, connected speech, and much more. We’ll compare similar sounds, and look at tricky topics like the glottal stop and the dark L. I've worked on this for YEARS and I am so happy to finally let you take the course!<br /><br />A massive thank you to Seonaid - her incredible grammar website really helped me to plan this lesson.
