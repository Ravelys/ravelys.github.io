{% raw %}Darin Haig discusses how the power of story telling, especially with the use of Dr. Seuss can change the way a child shares in therapy and how we all can identify with the stories we hear. <br /><br />Darin works with individuals, children and families struggling with issues ranging from severe mental illness to those who would simply like to continue on their current journey of self-exploration. Darin sees the therapeutic relationship as reciprocal and rooted in mutual respect, accountability and the desire for self-improvement. He specializes in couples/parenting work, pre-marital counseling and childrenâ€™s mental &amp; behavioral health.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
