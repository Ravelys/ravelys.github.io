{% raw %}UMBELICAL CORD ABNORMALITY<br /><br />The umbilical cord is a narrow tube-like structure that connects the developing baby to the placenta. The cord is sometimes called the baby's “supply line” because it carries the baby's blood back and forth, between the baby and the placenta. It delivers nutrients and oxygen to the baby and removes the baby's waste products.<br /><br />In this lecture we discussed about<br /><br />batteldore placenta<br />velamentous placenta'<br />short placental cord<br />long placental cord<br />single umbelical artery <br /><br />thanks for watching ... do subscribe for upcoming lectures on obstetric <br /><br />#neetpg #next #obstetric #placenta{% endraw %}
