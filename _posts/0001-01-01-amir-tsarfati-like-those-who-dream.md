{% raw %}“When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, we were like those who dream.” (Psalm 126:1) God uses dreams, sometimes to speak, to warn, or even to encourage. But there are also times when being like someone who dreams means you simply can’t believe the incredible events that you are witnessing. In his teaching, “Like Those Who Dream”, Amir Tsarfati sees in this verse the miraculous nature of the return of Israel to the land. As the number of Jews moving to their homeland continues to increase each year, prophecy is being fulfilled before our very eyes. It also reminds us that the clock is ticking down for the time of the Gentiles to end and the Messiah to return for His church.{% endraw %}
