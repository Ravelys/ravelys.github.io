{% raw %}A Playlist of High Quality Audio of A.R. Rahman. Hearing the genius of A.R. Rahman and H. Sridhar in all its true glory is something to treasure for all generations. Away from bad encodings or MP3s. Many hours of cleaning up the audio in my spare time, over months, reprocessing them to make then sound the finest ever possible. I wouldn't dare to do this with any of the newer releases but this quality was once lost from a generation later. I do not own the copyright to any of these songs and they belong to the respective owners.<br />Check Out the A.R. Rahman - H. Sridhar Playlist here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcDuBlGc_9i_UThESVYunufhSH2JTOqpf">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcDuBlGc_9i_UThESVYunufhSH2JTOqpf</a> #Remastered{% endraw %}
