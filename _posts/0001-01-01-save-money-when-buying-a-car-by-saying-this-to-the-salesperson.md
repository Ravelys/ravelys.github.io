{% raw %}In this video, I tell you how to save money when buying a new car by saying something specific to that car salesperson. It is a simple phrase, and it gets you both on the same page so that you can basically get straight to the point and you'll end up finding their bottom line price right away. Once you have found out that price, you can determine yourself if you are willing to pay it or not, and then you can purchase the car or choose a different vehicle that meets your price range.<br /><br /><br />CONNECT WITH ME:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mikechimmy/">https://www.instagram.com/mikechimmy/</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=helpfuldiy">https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=helpfuldiy</a><br /><br />FREE DIY ADVICE EBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/l/vFujc">https://gumroad.com/l/vFujc</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: Some of the links in this description may be affiliate links.
