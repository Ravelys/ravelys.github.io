{% raw %}The group of students who came across Akiko’s A-bombed piano made this wonderful narration. As the story of Akiko’s piano becomes more alluring every time it is told, the students hope to get a wider audience with this English version. Although it is not perfect, the junior high school students who made it, would be very happy if you took the time to watch it. <br /><br />The city of Hiroshima Citizens Affairs Bureau translated the script from Japanese to English. Jerry O’Sullivan helped the students with the pronunciation, and the world renowned pianist, Martha Argerich, recorded her voice for this video. We are very grateful to all the people who helped make this possible. <br /><br />Hiroshima city ushita middle school broadcast club<br /><br />We are surprised to find that our movie with German subtitles was made. <br />“Akiko's Piano (deutsche Untertitel) - Andenken an Atombombenabwurf auf Hiroshima 1945”<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akHpWUEKuA8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akHpWUEKuA8</a> <br />We are deeply grateful to the author of the German version.<br />Now we are hoping to find someone to write subtitles in other languages.
