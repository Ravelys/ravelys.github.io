{% raw %}My sincere apologies for keeping you waiting for a month with this video. It was supposed to only be 12 minutes long, but I got lost in the research and the scope and size of this topic, so I ended up making an almost one-hour long video. And still... I think this video doesn't contain enough information.<br />The Topic is India and Pakistan, their conflicts for independence and the historical background of such. As well as the conflicts that resulted out of independence. An overview of the Indian republic and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As well as a brief intermission on Bangladesh and the geopolitics surrounding Sri Lanka. I hope you enjoyed the video. Don't forget to support the channel. And as said in the video, here is a bibliography:<br /><br />Hermann Kulke - A History of India, 1998<br /><br />Frédéric Landy - Dictionnaire de l'Inde contemporaine, 2010 (many thanks to the French subscriber who provided translations and information)<br /><br />Laurent Gayer - Karachi: Ordered Disorder and the Struggle for the City, 2014<br /><br />Laurent Gayer - Armed Militias of South Asia: Fundamentalists, Maoists and Separatists, 2008<br /><br /><br />►You can support my channel on Patreon here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Kraut_and_Tea">https://www.patreon.com/Kraut_and_Tea</a><br /><br /><br /><br />►And you can also support me on PayPal here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/KrautandTea">https://www.paypal.me/KrautandTea</a><br /><br /><br />►And you can follow my twitter here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/notreallykraut">https://twitter.com/notreallykraut</a><br /><br />►And you can also follow me on Instagram here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/el_kraut/">https://www.instagram.com/el_kraut/</a><br /><br /><br />►Join my community, give feedback and talk to me here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://derserver.xyz/">http://derserver.xyz/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You might be interested in this video too:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhMAt3BluAU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhMAt3BluAU</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you again, and don't forget to subscribe to watch more.{% endraw %}
