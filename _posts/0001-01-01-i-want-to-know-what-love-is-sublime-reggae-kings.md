{% raw %}I Want To Know What Love Is - Sublime Reggae Kings Feat Lucca Giacco<br />Original by Foreigner - Lyrics:<br />I gotta take a little time, a little time to think things over<br />I better read between the lines, in case I need it when I'm older<br />Now this mountain I must climb, feels like the world upon my shoulders<br />Through the clouds I see love shine, it keeps me warm as life grows colder<br />In my life there's been heartache and pain<br />I don't know if I can face it again<br />Can't stop now, I've traveled so far to change this lonely life<br />I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me<br />I wanna feel what love is, I know you can show me, oh<br />I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me<br />I've got nowhere left to hide, it looks like love has finally found me<br />In my life there's been heartache and pain<br />I don't know if I can face it again<br />I can't stop now, I've traveled so far, to change this lonely life<br />I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me<br />I wanna feel what love is, I know you can show me<br />I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me<br />(I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is<br />(I know) I know you can show me<br />Let's talk about love (I wanna know what love is)<br />The love that you feel inside (I want you to show me)<br />And I'm feeling so much love (I wanna feel what love is)<br />No, you just can't hide (I know you can show me)<br />I wanna know what love is (let's talk about love), I know you can show me<br />I wanna feel (I want to feel what love is), oh, I wanna feel<br />Wanna know, wanna know, I know you can show me<br />Show me love is real, yeah, I want to know what love is<br />I wanna know, oh, oh (I want you to show me)<br />I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know (I wanna feel what love is)<br />I wanna feel<br /><br />#Sublime #Reggae #Kings #Covers{% endraw %}
