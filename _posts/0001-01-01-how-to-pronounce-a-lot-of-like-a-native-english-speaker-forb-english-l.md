{% raw %}Welcome to ForB's English lesson video! This time Kevin is going to explain how to pronounce &quot;a lot of&quot; like a native English speaker. How would you pronounce &quot;a lot of&quot;? Let's watch the video!üòÉüëç<br /><br />‚òÖTranscript<br />Hello, everyone. Welcome to ForB's English lesson video. I'm Kevin, and for today's video, we're going to practice the pronunciation of a very common phrase in English.<br /><br />As you can see, this phrase has three words, &quot;a, lot, of.&quot; However, most native speakers, when they say this phrase,  don't say it as three separate words. You won't hear people say, &quot;I-want-a-lot-of-beer.&quot; <br />That sounds a little unnatural. Instead, most people kind of push these words together, say them like a single word, &quot;alotof.&quot; So, instead, you'll hear, &quot;I want alotof beer.&quot; Notice, big difference, &quot;a-lot-of, alotof.&quot; <br /><br />We have to be very careful both when we're speaking and when we're listening to this sound. It sounds very different. So, let's start with the first two words, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;lot.&quot; This is very simple, just push them together. &quot;a lot, a lot.&quot; We don't really have to change much here. Just push them together. Don't have any break in saying them. Let's practice. Please repeat after me. &quot;alot, alot, alot.&quot; OK. Very good.<br /><br />Next, let's work with the middle and last words. You'll notice &quot;lot&quot; of course ends in a consonant, a &quot;t.&quot; Then &quot;of&quot; begins with a vowel, an &quot;o.&quot; <br />Often in English when one word ends in that hard consonant, the next word begins with a vowel, those will often combine together. Just like we're going to do today. <br /><br />However, we also have to be careful. The &quot;lot&quot; we don't want that hard, sharp &quot;t&quot; sound. Instead, we're going to soften it, more like a &quot;d&quot; sound. So, we won't say &quot;lot of&quot;, but &quot;lodof.&quot; So, you wanna soften to a &quot;d,&quot; not that sharp &quot;t.&quot; OK? So, let's practice. We're gonna put the &quot;lod&quot; and &quot;of.&quot; Again push them together. &quot;lodof, lodof.&quot; Repeat after me. &quot;lodof, lodof, lodof.&quot; OK. Very nice.<br /><br />Now, of course, we have to put everything together. Let's say that whole phrase like a single word. &quot;alodof, alodof.&quot; Don't forget, no sharp &quot;t.&quot; Try to say it like a &quot;d.&quot; &quot;alodof, alodof.&quot; OK. Repeat after me. &quot;alodof, alodof, alodof.&quot; OK. Got it? Three times very fast. &quot;alodof, alodof, aldof.&quot;<br /><br />Alright. Very good. Now, as I said, this is a really common phrase in English, so if can get comfortable saying it like a single word, in that natural way, soften the &quot;t&quot; to a &quot;d&quot; sound, you'll sound much more fluent and natural. So, please give it a try the next time you're speaking English. <br /><br />Well, thank you very much for watching our video today.
