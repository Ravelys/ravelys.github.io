This journey starts from the moment they realize they have a particular problem to the point where they purchase or discover a solution to the problem and beyond. This process is often known as the buyer’s journey or customer lifecycle.<br /><br />What are the stages of the buyer’s journey?<br /><br />It’s important to note that the buyer’s journey is not a one-size-fits-all process. Each customer journey will vary from brand to brand, but typically this journey is made up of five stages, which are:<br />Awareness<br />Consideration<br />Decision<br />Retention<br />Advocacy<br /><br />How you, as a business owner or marketer, approach your customer during each stage of their journey should be VERY different. <br /><br />In this video, we go into detail about each different stage of the buyer’s journey, discussing the different types of marketing content your prospect expects from you and when. <br /><br />Tailoring your marketing content based on the buyer’s journey makes everything flow so much smoother. Every customer has different needs and wants depending on their lifecycle stage, so it makes sense that your content caters to each buyer persona throughout each stage of the journey. Getting your buyer’s journey and the content required mapped out and created might seem like a lot of work to undertake to begin with, but I can promise you that your business will reap the benefits.<br /><br />For more information on how to communicate with your prospects based on their customer lifecycle you can check out our blog post, “How to Delight Your Customers at Each Stage of The Buyer’s Journey”, here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.hurree.co/blog/how-to-delight-your-customers-at-each-stage-of-the-buyers-journey">https://blog.hurree.co/blog/how-to-delight-your-customers-at-each-stage-of-the-buyers-journey</a><br /><br />You can also find an infographic based on the content in this video here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.hurree.co/blog/infographic-content-framework-five-stages-buyers-journey">https://blog.hurree.co/blog/infographic-content-framework-five-stages-buyers-journey</a> <br /><br />If you enjoyed this video and would like to learn about more ways to improve your market segmentation then please visit our resources:<br /><br />Hurree Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hurree.co/">https://www.hurree.co/</a> <br /><br />Hurree Blog:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.hurree.co/blog">https://blog.hurree.co/blog</a><br /><br />Hurree Resources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hurree.co/resources">https://www.hurree.co/resources</a>{% endraw %}
