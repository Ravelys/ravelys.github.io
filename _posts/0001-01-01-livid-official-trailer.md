{% raw %}Young caregiver Lucie finds new work with an ex-teacher in making home visits to elderly patients. Their last stop of the first day is at a dark, labyrinthine mansion owned by Madame Jessel, a comatose, former ballet instructor with a stern reputation. After learning that Madame Jessel is rumored to have a priceless treasure hidden somewhere deep within the sprawling estate, Lucie's boyfriend William convinces her and their pal Ben to stage a break-in on Halloween night. But the deeper the trio journeys into the mansion the more they learn that the house holds a terrifying secret. With no way out, they find themselves hopelessly caught in a twisted maze of unspeakable terror and supernatural torment. #Livid<br /><br />More from Madman Films: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.madmanfilms.com.au">http://www.madmanfilms.com.au</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com.au/madmanfilms">http://www.instagram.com.au/madmanfilms</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/madmanfilms">http://www.twitter.com/madmanfilms</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms">http://www.facebook.com/madmanfilms</a>{% endraw %}
