{% raw %}On Friday I faced one of my biggest fears.. public speaking! However, I cried in front of my whole class... so I am doing this video to prove to myself that I do know what I'm talking about! hahaha <br /><br />The star i discuss has 5 points: <br />Inclusion, communication, collaboration, sense-based learning and place-based learning. In the middle it says attention, as the morning activities conducted within school are all based around 'attention'. <br />This glow is inspired by Deleuze &amp; Guattari (1988) work, using the 'and.. and.. and..' concept, that this glow is constantly moving with an open and flexible environment and that is why I feel you can use it within every lesson, every day. As attention is empirical for learning and we should therefore foster this! <br /><br />Hannah B.{% endraw %}
