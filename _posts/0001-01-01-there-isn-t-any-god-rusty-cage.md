Most people know me from my song &quot;The Knife Game Song&quot;, but I also make all kinds of other music and videos, from folk, blues, hip-hop, skits and more. Covers and originals. Visit my channel and give it a listen. <br /><br />LYRICS:<br /><br />Some songs are happy<br /><br />Some songs are sad<br /><br />Some songs are really well rehearsed <br /><br />And other songs are bad<br /><br />Well some songs are angry <br /><br />And some songs are sweet<br /><br />Some songs are made to help you wake up in the morning <br /><br />Well heres a little song to help you go back to sleep…<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />There isn't any God and when you die you're just dead<br /><br />And heaven's just a fairy tale to put you to bed<br /><br />Sometimes I think about the chance that I'm wrong<br /><br />But then I close my eyes and sing the words to this song<br /><br />There isn't any God and when you die you're just dead<br /><br />And heaven's just a fairy tale to put you to bed<br /><br />There aint nobody watching us cause nobody cares<br /><br />and In the end we're living all alone<br /><br />Verse 2<br /><br />If I could live forever<br /><br />Id do it if I could<br /><br />leave it all behind everything that I've done<br /><br />Its almost just as bad as if its never begun<br /><br />If I was a believer<br /><br />Lord knows Ive tried<br /><br />Well I could be at peace when I close my eyes<br /><br />And I could go to heaven on the day that I die<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Bridge<br /><br />Love doesn't matter cause you die in the end<br /><br />Money doesn't matter cause you die in the end<br /><br />Life doesn't matter cause you die in the end<br /><br />But its really never over, no its really never over{% endraw %}
