{% raw %}Bond Strength in Polar Covalent Compound is Comparable to that of Ionic.<br />Bond strength in polar covalent compound is comparable to that of ionic “OR Comparison between bond strength of ionic and polar covalent compounds:<br />The polar covalent bond is formed between two or more atoms by unequal sharing of electrons while ionic bond is formed by the complete transfer of electrons. The ionic bond is stronger than the polar covalent bond. Both the bonds are comparable due to the following reasons.<br />• Both type of bonds forms between different electronegative atoms. In which one is more electronegative than the other. The more electronegative attract the electrons more towards itself.<br />• In pure ionic bond the bonded atoms attains positive and negative charges while in polar covalent bond partial positive and partial negative charges appears on the bonded atoms.<br />• Both the bonds are stronger type of bonds.{% endraw %}
