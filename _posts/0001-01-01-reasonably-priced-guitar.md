{% raw %}Doe's Tune, a short version of a tune I wrote.<br />Here I am playing my  'Reasonably Priced Guitar'<br />Recording trials, this is a 'dry' recording without any processing to show what a not too expensive guitar is capable of.<br />The tune is supposed to be gentle and meandering if feel.{% endraw %}
