Is this really your handwriting?<br />    Yes, when I’m not in a rush.<br /><br />2. Do you still maintain this kind of handwriting when you’re in a rush? <br />    No, it becomes sloppier. It’s hard to make all the letterforms consistent when I’m rushing.<br /><br />3. Do you write like this when you take notes during class lectures?<br />    Most of the time, yes. However, it also depends on the teacher and the amount of information they are giving throughout the lecture. <br />    - If the teacher talks less and/or creates summarized bullet points on the PowerPoint slides, then I can write as neatly as the one shown in this video. <br />    - If the teacher talks fast and has a lot of input, my handwriting becomes messy. By messy, I mean my “chicken scratch way” of writing. Messy notes are written on scratch papers, but I always make sure that I rewrite them in my notebook during my free time. Rewriting not only makes my notes look neat and organized, but it also helps me to retain information and improve my memory. Transferring can be time-consuming, but I’d rather invest my energy into something that contributes to my growth and knowledge. <br /><br />4. How did you learn to write like this?<br />    We had handwriting classes in grade school. Handwriting class was one of the subjects included in the school’s curriculum (just like math, but it did not involve as many neurons!). During those days, I worked on multiple worksheets daily. Somehow, I adapted the handwriting style that was taught to me and it has become a habit since then. As my handwriting teacher would always say, “Write neatly until it becomes as natural as breathing.”<br /><br />5. How do you hold your pen?<br />     Thumb tuck grip: my thumb is tucked under my index finger.<br /><br />6. How are you able to finish long essays during exams? <br />    I usually write a draft first with my chicken scratch handwriting. Then, I rewrite it as quickly and neatly as I can. I always make sure my handwriting looks legible for the teacher’s eyes. Although the content of the essay is what truly matters, I still believe that the handwriting has an influence on the examiner. I think a teacher will appreciate the work more if it’s written neatly; although I have to admit, I am usually one of the students who finishes writing last. (But I’m still able to finish it on time, so what’s the harm?)<br /><br />7. What’s your favorite pen?<br />    The MUJI smooth gel ink ballpoint pen<br /><br />● Amazon links are affiliate links.
