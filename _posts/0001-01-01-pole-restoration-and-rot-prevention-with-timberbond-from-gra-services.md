{% raw %}Utility poles damaged by woodpeckers or wood rot can easily be restored using the TimberBond pole restoration system from GRA Services International. <br /><br />The exposed end of a utility pole is vulnerable rotting from repeated exposure to water, wind, sun and changing temperatures.  When the pole cap rots, through bolts and equipment mounted toward the top of the pole become vulnerable to failure.  <br /><br />When woodpeckers create nesting holes in utility poles, they significantly weaken the pole, increasing the risk of additional weather decay and ultimately breakage.  <br /><br />Replacing a utility pole is very expensive.  The good news is that for a small fraction of the replacement cost, woodpecker and weather related rot damage can be repaired easily with TimberBond, restoring the utility pole to full strength and extending the useful life of the pole. <br /><br />TimberBond is specifically formulated to match the characteristics of wood including compression strength, fiber-to-fiber adhesion and modulus elasticity.   There is one aspect that is better than wood - TimberBond will not deteriorate like wood.  <br /><br />TimberBond is easily applied to a utility pole using a hand-held, battery powered application tool.  The lower viscosity formulation is ideal for filling deep interior holes, like woodpecker holes.  The heavier viscosity formula can then be used to seal the hole and is ideal for pole capping.  <br /><br />Many utility companies have discovered they can preventatively cap a new utility pole at installation with TimberBond  to provide protection from weather related rot from day one.  <br /><br />For decades, GRA Services has been developing affordable products to extend the useful life of utility structures, helping utility companies reduce operational cost and improve reliability.  <br /><br />Visit our website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.graservices.com">https://www.graservices.com</a> to learn more about TimberBond and our other utility pole restoration products or call us at 405-672-8885 M-F 8:30-5{% endraw %}
