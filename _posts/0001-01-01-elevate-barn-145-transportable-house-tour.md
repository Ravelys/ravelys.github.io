{% raw %}Elevate Homes latest building to head off our site and hit the road is an Elevate 145 with a barn style roof. This 3-bedroom, 2 bathroom,145m2 transportable home has proven particularly popular lately. Having the main living area at one end of the home and the bedrooms down the other, provides a great option for those with narrower sites, people who are looking to take advantage of fabulous views at one end of their property or simply those that like the appeal of a well thought out, architecturally designed home. Check out the video tour or visit www.elevatehomes.co.nz for more information.{% endraw %}
