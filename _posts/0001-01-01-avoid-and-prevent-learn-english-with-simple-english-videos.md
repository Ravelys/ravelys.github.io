{% raw %}This is an English vocabulary lesson about two useful verbs: avoid and prevent.<br />We explain their different meanings and give lots of examples so you can see the verbs in action. We also look at the grammar and see how they are both followed by gerunds (nouns made from verbs).<br /><br />Follow us on twitter as @VickiVideos so you don't miss out on future videos. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/VickiVideos">http://twitter.com/VickiVideos</a><br /><br />Follow our Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SimpleEnglishVideos/">https://www.facebook.com/SimpleEnglishVideos/</a><br /><br />And don't forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=vickihollettvideo">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=vickihollettvideo</a>{% endraw %}
