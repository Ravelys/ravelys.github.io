{% raw %}Roblox has a lot of magic themed games, but this one is a little different from the rest...<br />Follow my twitter - @JameskiiLive<br />Don't forget your charity shirt -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jameskii.com">https://jameskii.com</a><br /><br /><br />This Roblox experience is called Wacky Wizards and it's one of the best magic games on roblox. You don't really cast magic spells but instead you make potions which is very hilarious at times, as the results are often unexpected... I'm actually surprised by the lack of wizard games in Roblox, so if you know any good ones make sure to leave a comment and we might try it out :){% endraw %}
