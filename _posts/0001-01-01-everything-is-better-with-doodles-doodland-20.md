And an ordinary piece of sugar saves itself from the impending doom of falling into a cup of hot tea. As you can see, these little snacks lead lives just like ours, and they’re even aware of their own mortality. But it’s short videos like this that can really lift your spirits, on even the worst of bad days! Our channel proves that, from time to time, you can discover a whole new world among even the most ordinary things – all you need is a little bit of imagination!<br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />All product and company names shown in the video are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders.
