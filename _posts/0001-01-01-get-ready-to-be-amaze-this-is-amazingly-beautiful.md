{% raw %}::: ☆☆☆     ♡♡♡     ☆☆☆ :::<br />     Please don't forget to LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE to my YOUTUBE channel(Choco Hopie), and ring the bell button to get updated to my latest videos. 🛎👍 Your support is a great help, it's appreciated guys.<br />     Thank you so much for your time watching my videos.<br />     More videos to come. Stay cool and be yourself. 👌<br />-----------------------------------------<br /><br />     Stop worrying about the people who aren't happy for you. People who are not happy with themselves cannot possibly be happy for you.<br /><br />     Don't give them a taste of their own medicine. They already know what it tastes like. Give them a taste of your own medicine. If they lied, let your medicine be honesty. If they played with your emotions, let your medicine be maturity. Don't be afraid to be yourself, even if it means removing yourself from lives that you want to be in. You are, no doubt, worthy of being valued for who you are. So be who you are.<br /><br />     Keep climbing. You didn't come this far to only come this far. When you get this goal you'll seek more not more thing, more growth.<br />     Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far they can go. Every mountain top is within reach if you just keep climbing.<br />___________________________________________<br /><br />Matthew 16:19<br />     &quot;And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven&quot;.<br /><br />     Oh my Lord, I have sinned against your everlasting goodness. I am heartily sorry and I resolve not to commit sin anymore with the help of Your grace. I humbly ask for Your pardon. Pardon me Lord, pardon me. Pardon, Oh my God, pardon me my offenses, pardon Lord grant me. Amen. 🙏<br />___________________________________________{% endraw %}
