The same goes for your personal life. Which option you choose will determine how effective, meaningful, significant, and fulfilling your life becomes. In this message, Pastor Rick tells us how God has given us both a guidebook in the Bible and a personal guide in the Holy Spirit. You’ll learn the ways the Holy Spirit wants to help us and guide us, and the necessary steps to take to be led by him. Find out how to wait for God’s response, trust his guidance, hear his voice, and rely on the Holy Spirit’s power instead of your own willpower!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Continue the conversation online with our online community throughout the week during live services and weekly small groups at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://saddleback.com/online">http://saddleback.com/online</a><br /><br />Learn more about this message series at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://saddleback.com/yourfuture">http://saddleback.com/yourfuture</a><br /><br /><br /><br />(Saddleback Church) (Future) (My Future) (Future plans) (Holy Spirit)(God's guidance) (Holy Ghost) (Spirit of God) (God's helper) (Guidance from God) (Revelation of God) (Holy Spirit reveals) (Listen to the Holy Spirit) (What is the Holy Spirit) (God helps you) (God's timing) (How to be led by the Holy Spirit) (Waiting on God) (Listening to the Holy Spirit){% endraw %}
