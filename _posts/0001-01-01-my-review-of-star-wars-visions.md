{% raw %}This is my review of Visions. Overall it was cool. Some episodes were a very boring. Others were captivating and amazing. I'd love if they continued on the shows that I enjoyed, maybe into a series.<br />I recommend watching this show, it was fun and unique with a star wars feel in an anime world. You can skip the episodes you don't like, and watch the ones you do.<br /><br /><br />Continue the conversation on the Theory forums!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts">https://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts</a><br /><br />Become a Patron to support future content - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory">https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join</a>{% endraw %}
