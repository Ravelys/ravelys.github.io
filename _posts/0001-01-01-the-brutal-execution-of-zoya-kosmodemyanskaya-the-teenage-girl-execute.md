{% raw %}During the Second World War, there was a significant degree of resistance against the Nazis and Germans as they captured large amounts of territory and land. The most successful resistance group was the Partisans, who operated in the Balkan States and did cause significant damage to the German Army. They also helped the Red Army's advances towards the end of the conflict, but the Partisans utilised many different people to conduct operations. <br /><br />Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya was just a teenage girl, being 18 years old when she was executed by the Nazis for her involvement in Partisan activities. She had been caught attempting to burn a barn in a small Soviet village, as she and fellow Partisans had tried to carry out Stalin's orders to sabotage German settlements. After she was captured she was horrifically tortured but refused to give over any information to her enemies. Because of this the Germans sentenced her to death. <br /><br />Days after her capture, she was led out from her prison cell in the freezing cold snow. A large crowd had gathered to witness her execution, and she defiantly went to her death calling on the crowd to rise up against the Germans. She was only just 18 when she was killed. <br /><br />So join us today as we look at, 'The BRUTAL Execution Of Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya - The Teenage Girl Executed By The Nazis.' <br /><br />Thanks for watching!
