{% raw %}On the latest episode of the LA Football Podcast, Ryan gets into all the LA Football storylines that happened over the weekend.<br /><br />He was in attendance of the Rams and Lions game and witnessed firsthand the win and Matthew Stafford's 300th touchdown pass (Cooper Kupp was on the receiving end). The Rams got the win, but should there be concern over how close it was? Then on Monday, the Rams traded starting linebacker Kenny Young for a future draft pick. Why?<br /><br />UCLA fought back against Oregon but came up just a bit short. Is Chip Kelly on the hot seat?<br /><br />USC lost to rival Notre Dame in a game that was never really close. Another stain on a lost year, but a new coach's name was thrown into the ring. Reason for excitement?<br /><br />Finally, the Chargers are back from their bye week. Are they ready for redemption?<br /><br />Rams Party Bus Event: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lafbnetwork.com/product/lafb-party-bus-from-golden-road-to-sofi-stadium-rams-vs-titans/">https://www.lafbnetwork.com/product/lafb-party-bus-from-golden-road-to-sofi-stadium-rams-vs-titans/</a><br /><br />Chargers Party Bus Event: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lafbnetwork.com/product/lafb-party-bus-from-golden-road-to-sofi-stadium-chargers-vs-steelers/">https://www.lafbnetwork.com/product/lafb-party-bus-from-golden-road-to-sofi-stadium-chargers-vs-steelers/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the LA Football Podcast wherever you listen to podcasts and follow us on YouTube and Social Media at @LAFBNetwork.<br /><br />Frostee Rucker Social – @TheOrganicFrost<br /><br />Ryan Dyrud Social – @RyanDyrudLAFB<br /><br />Sponsors:<br /><br />Golden Road Brewery: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goldenroad.la/">https://www.goldenroad.la/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.BetOnline.Ag">https://www.BetOnline.Ag</a>{% endraw %}
