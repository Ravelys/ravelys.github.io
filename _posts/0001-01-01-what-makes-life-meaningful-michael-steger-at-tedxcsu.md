{% raw %}Michael F. Steger is an Associate Professor of Psychology at Colorado State University. He has spent more than a decade researching people's ability to find meaning in their lives and the benefits of living a meaningful life. In his talk, he asks the question &quot;What Makes Life Meaningful?&quot; and will share what psychological science can tell us about the answer. He is the co-editor of 'Designing Positive Psychology' and the forthcoming 'Purpose and Meaning in the Workplace.'<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
