{% raw %}A countdown of some of the greatest UK TV adverts ever made. Including adverts from the 70s right up until 2013, spend an hour taking a look back over some of the most amazing and creative adverts ever to be shown on UK television: some of them you may or may not recognise! Brands include Guinness, Cadbury, Volkswagen, Heineken, Stella Artois, Honda and MANY MORE! I've created this countdown in HD, as well as scouring the internet for ads of the highest quality (most of them anyway) for your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Find the 2 easter eggs in the video and win nothing. <br /><br />Many, many thanks to all of my patrons, both past and present:<br />Angel Poynter<br />Beaux<br />The Biophone<br />Çevik Basmaci<br />Dennis Guttmann<br />EmiLightning<br />GBP Broadcasting<br />George Smith<br />Glitchygoats <br />Jenna Martinko<br />Mary &amp; Carrie<br />Night Sky <br />PacMasterStudios<br />Robot_Destroyer<br />Samouss<br /><br />If you'd like to be as awesome as these folks by supporting me on Ko-fi, the link can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/helloimapizza">https://ko-fi.com/helloimapizza</a><br /><br /><br />LINKS:<br />► WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://helloimapizza.com">http://helloimapizza.com</a><br />► FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/helloimapizza/">https://www.facebook.com/helloimapizza/</a><br /><br /><br />Intro/Outro song by TeknoAXE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/3EvrahIhqGM">http://youtu.be/3EvrahIhqGM</a>{% endraw %}
