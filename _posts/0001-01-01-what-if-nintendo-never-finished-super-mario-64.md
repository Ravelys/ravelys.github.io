{% raw %}If Nintendo scrapped Super Mario 64, my life would be completely different. Lets take a look at the Super Mario 64 beta levels shown at Space World in 1995 and see what we can find!<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by eriksenchee<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eriksenchee">https://twitter.com/eriksenchee</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=904L3WyW89M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=904L3WyW89M</a><br /><br />Simply plays Super Mario 64 beta levels on his Twitch tv speedrun livestream. The mario beta levels were both interesting and annoying to play, but not as annoying as Nintendo anti-piracy screens. Like the game would be annoying to do a super mario 64 speedrun or get a world record. Anyway, the history of super mario 64 is quite interesting, especially because every copy of Super Mario 64 is personalized. Simplyn64 super mario 64 speedrun world record could maybe be in the history of mario 64. Well, my work here is done. Oh how could I forget - Mizkif super mario 64 streams. Or maybe some Simply mizkif? How about some Mizkif simply? Byeee{% endraw %}
