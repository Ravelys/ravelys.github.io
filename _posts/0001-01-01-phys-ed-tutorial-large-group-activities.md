{% raw %}We were blown away by the international response to our previous Phys Ed Tutorial videos - so we decided to make some more! We're happy and honoured that so many people were able to make use of the activities we shared.<br /><br />As part of our Enduring Priority to foster a Culture of Wellness in our Division, we are continuing to develop video resources designed to assist schools who may not have a Phys Ed specialist on staff. There are some great examples of Daily Physical Activity (DPA) happening all over Parkland School Division. Here's the latest from teachers Mark Bradshaw, Will Chan and Nathan McLachlan from Woodhaven Middle School in Spruce Grove. Special thanks to last year's Grade 7, 8 and 9 students at Woodhaven School for their participation in this demonstration.{% endraw %}
