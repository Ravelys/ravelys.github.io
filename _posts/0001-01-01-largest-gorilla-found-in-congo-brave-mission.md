If so, get ready because we found the largest one in the Congo!<br /><br />On our first Brave Mission, host Mark Vins is teaming up with the Rangers of Virunga National Park to search for some of the last remaining Mountain Gorillas in the Congo - including the largest Silverback in the region. While trekking for these gigantic primates, Mark and his elite camera team must evade poachers and rogue militias in the DRC, while learning how to protect its critically endangered wildlife from extinction. The mission to save Africa’s oldest national park will transport viewers to the front-lines of conservation and invite them to participate in the goal to rewild our planet – which is now more critical than ever. <br /><br />From Executive Producer’s Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Vins, comes this thrilling mission to prove that conservation IS action!<br /><br />To see everything that YouTube and Google are doing to create a more sustainable Earth, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sustainability.google">https://sustainability.google</a><br /><br />00:00:00 Most Dangerous Road<br /><br />3:05 Trekking for Gorillas <br /><br />7:09 Gorilla Fight <br /><br />09:11 Gorilla Feast    <br /><br />10:22 Largest Gorilla in the Congo     <br /><br /> 14:22 Behind Enemy Lines  <br /><br /> 17:10 Most Dangerous Mammal in Africa   <br /><br />  21:59 A Solution to Save the Park    <br /><br />  25:19 Jane Goodall joins Our Mission{% endraw %}
