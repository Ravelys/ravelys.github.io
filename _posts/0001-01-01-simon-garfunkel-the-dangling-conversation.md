{% raw %}&quot;The Dangling Conversation&quot; is a song written by Paul Simon, first released in September 1966 as a Simon and Garfunkel single &quot;The Dangling Conversation&quot;/&quot;The Big Bright Green Pleasure Machine.&quot; The song only climbed to 25 on the US charts and never made it onto the UK charts. Paul Simon was amazed it was not a big hit. He put it down to the song's heaviness. It was released a month later as a recording on the Simon and Garfunkel album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.<br /><br /><br /><br />The theme is failed communication between lovers. The song starts in a room washed by shadows from the sun slanting through the lace curtains and ends with the room &quot;softly faded.&quot; They are as different as the poets they read: Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost.{% endraw %}
