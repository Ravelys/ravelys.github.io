{% raw %}How to raise your standards and quality of life so you can reach your full potential.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email success story from a viewer who shares how my work has impacted his personal and professional life for the better. He grew up without a father and was raised by a single mom who did the best she could, but he says she simply wasn’t equipped to raise boys.<br /><br /><br /><br />“It doesn’t matter how you start or where you start from, but that you simply make the decision to choose to be great in all areas of your life that are important to you, and then take relentless action to make it happen. The world is full of examples of people who had every disadvantage and every reason to be mediocre and average, but they still managed to be exceptional and accomplish amazing things. Success is a way of life. Successful people choose on a daily basis to be productive, learn from their mistakes, refine their approach and continually look for ways to keep moving forward so they can shape and change their destiny for the better.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “How To Raise Your Standards &amp; Quality Of Life” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/how-to-raise-your-standards-quality-of-life/68555">https://understandingrelationships.com/how-to-raise-your-standards-quality-of-life/68555</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
