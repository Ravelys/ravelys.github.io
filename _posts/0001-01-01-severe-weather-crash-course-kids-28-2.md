{% raw %}So, what's the difference between &quot;weather&quot; and &quot;severe weather&quot;? Is it just how hard the wind is blowing? Is it just thunder and lighting? Well, it can be some or all of those things. In this episode of Crash Course Kids, Sabrina talks to us about what makes Severe Weather and how it interacts with the Geosphere and Biosphere. <br /><br />///Standards Used in This Video///<br />5-ESS2-1. Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact. [Clarification Statement: Examples could include the influence of the ocean on ecosystems, landform shape, and climate; the influence of the atmosphere on landforms and ecosystems through weather and climate; and the influence of mountain ranges on winds and clouds in the atmosphere. The geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere are each a system.] [Assessment Boundary: Assessment is limited to the interactions of two systems at a time.]<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Crash Course Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse">https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse">https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse">http://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse</a><br />Tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com">http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com</a><br /><br />Credits...<br />Producer &amp; Editor: Nicholas Jenkins<br />Cinematographer &amp; Director: Michael Aranda<br />Host: Sabrina Cruz<br />Script Supervisor: Mickie Halpern<br />Writer: Kay Boatner<br /><br />Executive Producers: John &amp; Hank Green<br />Consultant: Shelby Alinsky<br />Script Editor: Blake de Pastino<br /><br />Thought Cafe Team:<br />Stephanie Bailis<br />Cody Brown<br />Suzanna Brusikiewicz<br />Jonathan Corbiere<br />Nick Counter<br />Kelsey Heinrichs<br />Jack Kenedy<br />Corey MacDonald<br />Tyler Sammy<br />Nikkie Stinchcombe <br />James Tuer<br />Adam Winnik{% endraw %}
