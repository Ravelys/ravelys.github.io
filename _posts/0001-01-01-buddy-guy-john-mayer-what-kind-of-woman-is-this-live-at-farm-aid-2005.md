Dave Matthews joined Farm Aid's board of directors in 2001.<br /><br />For more information about Farm Aid, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://farmaid.org/youtube">http://farmaid.org/youtube</a><br /><br />Farm Aid's performances are donated by the artists in order to raise funds and raise awareness for family farmers.
