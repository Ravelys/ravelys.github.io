{% raw %}Sky News Washington Correspondent Annelise Nielsen says there is a “very real possibility” US President Joe Biden could decline quickly.<br /><br />“I have to say, for someone watching this day in, day out, it’s not something to discount,” she told Sky News host Andrew Bolt. <br /><br />“We do know he’s quite advanced in age and that doesn't mean that it precludes you from doing the job but there’s definitely at least a bit of cause for concern among the general populace.”{% endraw %}
