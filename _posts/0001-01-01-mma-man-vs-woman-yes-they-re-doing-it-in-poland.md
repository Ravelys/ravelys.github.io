{% raw %}Song is &quot;STINKY HAOWSE&quot; by Bill Jobs<br />The two fights featured here occurred at the Polish promotion MMA-VIP. The first fight was Piotr 'Mua Boy' Lisowski who beat a lady named Ula Siekacz, who is nicknamed 'ArmPowerGirl'. In the second fight, Michal Przybylowicz AKA &quot;Polish Ken&quot; beat Wiktoria Dom≈ºalska.<br /><br />These are not the first intergender MMA matches, but they might just be the hardest to watch{% endraw %}
