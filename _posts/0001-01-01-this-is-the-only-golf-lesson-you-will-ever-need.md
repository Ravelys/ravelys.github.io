Each how to video explains everything a golfer needs to know so they can improve their golf game and start lowering their scores, so whether your trying to break 100, break 90, break 80 or break 70 then this channel will help you achieve everything you want. <br /><br />New videos out every weekday.<br /><br />I'll always try to put my swing on slow motion on the camera however this is sometimes difficult due to the set up of my driving range and I'm often looking for privacy but I agree that seeing a Professional swing in slow motion can help golfers develop. <br /><br />I do use the term perfect golf swing, not because there is a perfect golf swing or perfect backswing etc however I like to discuss options in all my videos and strongly believe there are 5 or 6 things we have to do in the golf swing but there are options for golfers to choose what they want to do which is why I feel im qualified to discuss the perfect golf swing as much as anybody else. <br /><br />The areas I disucss in the golf swing are hip rotation, swing plane, upper body movements, how to gain speed in your golf swing, how to use the driver, all golf swing basics, golf swing for seniors, golf swing for irons, the elbow positions and whats the best way to swing a golf club and much more. <br /><br />I also do a lot of club reviews with Midlands Golf and specially Ronnie and coach at Four Ashes and a friend who helps me as I'm not the most technical person when it comes to club equipment, but we talk about what are the best golf clubs, golf bags, golf balls and even golf trolleys. Everyone wants to know whats the best golf club and especially the best driver which is why we test all of the clubs and give our opinion on what the best golf clubs are. <br /><br />We talk about the popular tournaments upcoming especially the masters as this is a favourite for every golfer.<br /><br />We do all of this from our happy home Four Ashes Golf Centre. <br /><br />So if your keen on learning the best way to swing a golf club, the best latest golf wedge, or interested in online golf lessons, what have Taylormade golf launched now?, or is the latest Callaway driver acyually longer than the prevoius model?<br /><br />Then press that subscribe buttion, ring those bells and join me on my journey into golf and who knowas where we'll end up.{% endraw %}
