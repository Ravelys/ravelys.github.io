{% raw %}Why do structures big and small sink into the ground, and what can we do to stop it?<br />☕ Sign up to Morning Brew for free today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/mbpracticalengineering">https://bit.ly/mbpracticalengineering</a><br /><br />Before the so-called Starbase supported crazy test launches of the Starship spaceflight program, it was just a pile of dirt. After nearly two years, they hauled most of that soil back off the site for disposal. It might seem like a curious way to start a construction project, but foundations are critically important. Building that giant dirt pile was a clever way to prevent these facilities from sinking into the ground over time.<br /><br />Practical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
