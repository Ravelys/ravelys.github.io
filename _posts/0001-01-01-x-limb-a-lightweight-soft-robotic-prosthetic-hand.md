{% raw %}We have developed an open-source 3D printed soft robotic prosthetic hand with multi-functional capability addressing the gap between existing designs and the practical requirements.<br /><br />More details are provided in the following open-access paper in PLoS ONE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232766">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0232766</a><br /><br />The open-source files are available in the following GitHub repository:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/MelbourneUniHRL/X-Limb">https://github.com/MelbourneUniHRL/X-Limb</a><br /><br />Main characteristics of the X-Limb design:<br />- Overall weight: 253gr<br />- Grasp types: Three grasps types (power, pinch, and tripod) with capability of individual finger movement<br />- Grip force: Power grasp force of 21.5N and pinch grasp force of 10.2N<br />- Hand closing/opening speed: 1.3sec<br />- Cost: Bill of material cost of 200 USD (excluding quick disconnect wrist but without factoring in the cost reduction through mass production).{% endraw %}
