{% raw %}Finally! A car that harks back to the good old days of French cars. See why the C5 X is the car no one asked for yet we desperately want.<br /><br />It's partly to do with it being a bit of an oddity design-wise. Most of Citroen's range is made up of crossovers, SUVs and MPVs because they're big sellers. So when it decided to launch a more premium car, the brief was to mix in luxury saloon elements with the high-riding nature of a crossover. Oh, and it has an estate/ shooting brake-style silhouette for practicality. The C5 X can be had with a 1.6-litre petrol engine hooked up to an electric motor for zero-emission driving. It's a plug-in hybrid (PHEV), meaning you can drive for up to 31 miles on electric power alone. It also comes with new multi-chamber suspension (or cushions as Citroen likes to call it) that iron out nasty bumps in the road. We'll have to wait until next year to see if Citroen is on to a winner with the C5 X but in the meantime here's everything you need to know about the crossover/limo/shooting brake.<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Subscribe for more awesome car videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YesAutoUK?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/YesAutoUK?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¥ Check out our other videos:<br />NEW Audi Q5 Sportback review - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3kl0UXd">https://bit.ly/3kl0UXd</a><br />DS 4 2022 first look  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3yf7mUn">https://bit.ly/3yf7mUn</a><br />2021 Vauxhall Mokka review - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2UHXmoY">https://bit.ly/2UHXmoY</a><br /><br />Find great deals on new and used Citroens at YesAuto - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XVogLp">https://bit.ly/2XVogLp</a><br /><br />Who are YesAuto?<br /><br />YesAuto is here to make car buying enjoyable and easy.
