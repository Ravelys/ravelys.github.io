{% raw %}My husband Chris and I were driving home from Vermont talking about a conversation that he and his older brother had had about whether or not it’s possible to change who you are…especially once you’re over 50, like us….<br /><br />To become more extroverted, if you are introverted. To be more jovial and optimistic if you’ve been a real cynical jerk. To heal if you’ve been traumatized or abused. <br /><br />I went OFF on this topic, with a ton of passion. We cover everything from:<br /><br />✅ What Chris REALLY thinks about the guy he sees reflected back in the mirror 😢<br /><br />✅ Why I’ve woken up for 45 years on edge - feeling like something is wrong. <br /><br />✅ Where to start if you want to change. <br /><br />✅ Breaking generational patterns.<br /><br />✅ Why “tough love” is bullshit. <br /><br />✅ Healing your nervous system and why it matters<br /><br />✅ How to put yourself first, and why you don’t. <br /><br />✅ Meditation and how it is different than the #high5habit - why you need both<br /><br />✅ How to stop being so hard on yourself. <br /><br />I also teach you a very cool science backed tool called - high fiving your heart. I also write about it and how to use it to gain the energy, focus and control you need in my new book The High 5 Habit.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as we enjoyed sharing this car ride with you ❤️🙌<br /><br />Ps. Just don’t play this one for your kids because I got so fired up I definitely dropped a few four letter words… Just being me and I’m super passionate about you and your ability to change your behavior, to change your mindset and to change absolutely anything and everything you’d like to change about your life. <br /><br />If you need a boost of motivation or support right now this would be an excellent thing to take a listen to…{% endraw %}
