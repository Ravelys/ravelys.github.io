{% raw %}Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: &quot;Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.&quot; <br /><br />Aye so a lot of these websites are nonsense. You can't legally own land that small in Scotland.  You're paying for a PDF.<br /><br />Sorry this video isn't the best quality, went from finding out about these websites to rendering the .mp4 in about 18 hours.  Not uploaded a YouTube video since 2014, so I think it's pretty clear I've not got a clue what I'm doing anymore.  Anyway, see you in another six years if we're still here.
