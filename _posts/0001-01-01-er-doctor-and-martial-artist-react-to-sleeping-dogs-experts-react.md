{% raw %}Welcome to a much-requested Experts REACT to Sleeping Dogs, featuring ER Doctor Jordan Wagner and Martial Artist Noah Fleder. Today the guys are going to be looking into how brutal Sleeping Dogs actually is with its combination of fused martial art skills and the use of surroundings to mutilate the competition. Whilst Noah reviews the extensive range of moves demonstrated by Wei Shen, Doctor Wagner is constantly on the lookout for what he can do to help the situation (like any sane doctor would).<br /><br />Sleeping Dogs is an action-adventure game played in an open world environment from a third-person perspective. Players take control of Chinese-American police officer Wei Shen, who infiltrates the Sun On Yee Triad organization as an undercover agent. During the first few missions of the game, you gain an understanding of how to control your character. Following these missions, the player is free to explore the game's world and take part in side missions and other activities. Shen navigates the world by running, jumping, climbing over obstacles, and driving a car, boat, or motorcycle.<br />-------------------- <br />Dr. Jordan Wagner on YouTube AND follow him on Instagram.
