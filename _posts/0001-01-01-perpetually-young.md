{% raw %}&quot;I like to go a wandering, along a mountain track...&quot;<br /><br />For Frank, this is what has kept him perpetually young - being up in the mountains, out in nature.  It’s probably no surprise that something about nature makes us feel more alive and vital - it allows us to feel better, to think better, and to deepen our understanding of ourselves and others.<br /><br />While we might carry the accumulation of years on our bodies and on our face, we can stay young at heart. That’s one of the most beautiful things anyone can do.<br /><br />“If wrinkles must be written upon our brows, let them not be written upon the heart. The spirit should never grow old.” – James A.
