The  exaggerated rain effect has also made it hard to drive, especially in first-person view. While there appear to big little in the way of game-breaking issues, small upgrades can be made to enhance the general quality of life and gameplay experience. The modding community has already begun making changes, but also have been dealing with Rockstar and Take-Two studios every step of the way.<br /><br />Remember to subscribe to GameSpot's YouTube page for more GTA coverage including our video about the rough Nintendo Switch port, as well as a collection of bugs and glitches throughout the trilogy.<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:31 - Rain<br />01:10 - Aiming<br />01:45 - Character Models<br />02:09 - Mission Briefings MIA<br />02:42 - Audio Issues<br />03:18 - General Bugginess{% endraw %}
