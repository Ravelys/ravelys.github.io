{% raw %}The Bible mentions besetting sins, but we need to remember that when it mentions them, it tells us to lay them aside. Some people will wrongly ease their conscience and not put away their besetting sins. We need to do what the Bible says and lay them aside (along with every weight).<br /><br />ðŸŽ§MP3 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://illbehonest.com/download/we-need-to-lay-aside-our-besetting-sins-tim-conway.mp3">https://illbehonest.com/download/we-need-to-lay-aside-our-besetting-sins-tim-conway.mp3</a><br /><br /><br />â†’ View on I'll Be Honest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://illbehonest.com/we-need-to-lay-aside-our-besetting-sins">https://illbehonest.com/we-need-to-lay-aside-our-besetting-sins</a><br /><br />â†’ Excerpt is taken from the full sermon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiuVQP7_Lw4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiuVQP7_Lw4</a>{% endraw %}
