This section is about Standard American English, but there's something here for everyone.<br /><br />About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.<br /><br />For free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything<br /><br />Subscribe to Khan Academyâ€™s Grammar channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8JT97hQjMVWeO0B-x8eVxQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8JT97hQjMVWeO0B-x8eVxQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Subscribe to Khan Academy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=khanacademy&quot;">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=khanacademy&quot;</a>{% endraw %}
