{% raw %}In this tutorial we discuss the information available on Halifax.ca, our municipal website, and the Building &amp; Development Permits webpages to better support you in competing online applications. <br /><br />Access to permitting information has been re-designed with enhanced searchability. <br /><br />Weâ€™ve added a lot of information and simplified language for enhanced accessibility and greater transparency around the permitting process. The intention is to empower you to be self-sufficient, and less reliant on calling or visiting Customer Service Centers. <br /><br />We have modernized and redesigned the permitting webpages, now referred to as Building &amp; Development Permit Pages. <br /><br />Overall, the information on the website sets the standards for applications, transfers some of the responsibility for meeting those standards to you, and helps you plan for success.<br /><br />It is important to be familiar with our webpages, so you can confidently navigate the permitting process and effectively use the Customer Portal.<br /><br />After viewing this tutorial. please proceed to tutorial #4.
