{% raw %}A wide array of experiences, ranging from a mild emotional detachment from the immediate surroundings, to a more severe disconnection from physical and emotional experiences<br /><br />Video instalation<br />(semester work)<br /><br />Annotation:<br />Dissociation. Disconnection. Virtual reality. The concept of feeling real. Feeling valid. Feeling validation. My work is based around my intimate feelings. Because of my struggles with my mental health<br />I developed coping mechanisms that is called dissociation. My ability to ignore the world around<br />me is triggered by any minor issues. When I feel overwhelmed, unhappy, stressed, alone.<br />With YouTube and people documenting basic everyday life<br />I found that for me it is way easier to live theirs than mine. After talking with people from my age group I found out that a lot of us have issues with their identity because of these videos. And the YouTube algorithm doesn’t help.<br />For my work I choose a specific way how to find videos. I created a profile of an 18 year old girl and started to click on videos I was suggested. Soon my page was filled with videos of perfect influencers sharing everything form their life. I choose the ones that bring me comfort.<br />I don’t wanna face my feelings. It’s not something easy. I am not always happy with who I am. And in a fake reality I can be whoever I want. I feel alone. I feel lost. I feel trapped. I feel void.<br />But it’s way easier to disconnect.{% endraw %}
