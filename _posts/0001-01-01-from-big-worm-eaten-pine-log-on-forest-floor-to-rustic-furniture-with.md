{% raw %}What would we do without chainsaw mills?!  I had a half of a good-sized white pine log laying next to my tent for the last year that needed a good use.  Do people make tables from pine?  I guess I do, especially if they have so many knots and nice character.  So I dragged the log from the trees with the atv and planked it up with the chainsaw mill to see what I could create.  Let's hope she likes it!<br /><br /><br />Because Iâ€™ve gotten so many questions about the gear that I use on the channel, here are some of the most important pieces I use every day: <br /><br />My Favorite Piece of Gear- Chainsaw Helmet   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3uuW5xB">https://amzn.to/3uuW5xB</a><br />Granberg Chainsaw Mill   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cdRXvn">https://amzn.to/3cdRXvn</a><br />How I Keep the Mosquitoes Away!   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3frenvh">https://amzn.to/3frenvh</a><br />Big, Black Log-Peeling Knife - Becker BK9    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oZIeOH">https://amzn.to/3oZIeOH</a><br />The Trailer I Use Behind My 4 Wheeler- Yutrax    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fvO8DK">https://amzn.to/3fvO8DK</a><br />Bug Net Rooms I Use    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3uwOK0l">https://amzn.to/3uwOK0l</a><br />Portable Heaters in My Tent and the Deer Castle    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3frQ7Jh">https://amzn.to/3frQ7Jh</a><br /><br />Thank you all so much for supporting this crazy endeavor!
