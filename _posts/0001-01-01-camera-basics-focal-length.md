Sonata is a music licensing service designed for creators.  Full of professional artists, Sonata contains an endless library of high-quality tracks that is leaps and bounds better than other stock music platforms.  Powered by AI and designed with direct input from creators, Sonata's search engine has advanced features making finding the perfect track easy.<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Through animation, I explain various aspects of focal length, from the principle of the subject, to crop factor, and finally the different classifications of lenses.  <br />________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />I am releasing animations once every month.  This animation was a bit late, because I decided to compose in 8K and then scale it down for some reason, and After Effects threw me a loop so it ended up only in 1080p anyway.  These videos take me about 20-30 hours to make, from start to finish.  If you have any constructive criticism, put it in the comments, and leave suggestions as to what  subjects you would like me to cover in the future.<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Credits:<br />Animation, Vector Design: Vincent Ledvina<br />Voiceover: contracted from Fiverr<br />Music: In That Smile - Mattia Cupelli<br />Sound Effects: Created by myself and sourced online<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Thank you for watching!
