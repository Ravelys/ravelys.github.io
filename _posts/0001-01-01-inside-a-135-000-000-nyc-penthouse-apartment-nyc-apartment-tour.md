Designed by Rafael Vinoly, this extraordinary 96 story tower rises 1,396 feet and redefines the Manhattan skyline. All windows measure an expansive 10 feet by 10 feet, flooding residences with abundant natural light and spectacular views of Central Park, the Hudson and East Rivers, Atlantic Ocean, and many iconic Manhattan buildings and avenues.<br /><br />The interiors of the residences, designed by celebrated architect Deborah Berke, epitomize elegance and sophistication. Residences feature 12’-6” finished ceilings, private elevator landings, service entrances, windowed eat-in kitchens, and large master bedroom suites with two bathrooms and adjoining dressing rooms.
