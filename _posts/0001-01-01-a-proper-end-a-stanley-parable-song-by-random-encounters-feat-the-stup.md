How would he do his job?<br />Stanley had to fix this!<br /><br />Stanley stepped out of his office through the door.<br />Took the stairway up to check the second floor.<br />To the right, Stanley kept his storage: That was where his instincts led.<br />But instead of right, he set his sights on the room to the left instead.<br /><br />Stanley knew this room was not the proper choice,<br />But he sat down and ignored his inner voice…<br />This whole “story” thing was something Stanley couldn’t comprehend.<br />Let’s start over and find a proper end.<br /><br />Stanley’s buttons had blah, blah, blah...<br />You know how this goes.<br />Stanley had to fix this!<br /><br />Stanley took the right-hand door to- no, STANLEY, RIGHT!<br />It appeared that Stanley wasn’t very bright…<br />Now the story’s utter rubbish, and it’s frankly all your fault.<br />Your disdain for my directions brought our plot line to a halt!<br /><br />Let me see if I can get us back on course…<br />Oh dear. Now how’d we find ourselves outdoors?<br />I admit, this all seems foreign, but I loathe to recommend<br />We start over and find a proper end.<br /><br />Or at least something with air conditioning…<br /><br />Hang on, Stanley. I have an idea. Let’s try something different…<br /><br />This should make our story shine! The STANLEY PARABLE ADVENTURE LINE!<br />Now the plot is much more clear- Why’d it lead us into here…?<br /><br />That’s not right… No, surely not. Is this much closer to the plot?<br />How’s it worse with every turn?!  -Oh, isn’t this a lovely fern?<br /><br />…well? Isn’t it?<br /><br />No… I suppose it isn’t. My standards are just becoming painfully low… <br /><br />Stanley took the- hold on, Stanley’s disappeared…<br />Stanley slept through his alarm, just as I feared…<br />Well, our story doesn’t need him! What’d Stanley ever do?<br />We’ll find him a replacement… like you!<br /><br />Yes, it’s perfect! This new Stanley’s much improved!<br />Other than the fact that Stanley hasn’t moved…<br /><br />Come on, make us a decision!<br />Think like Stanley! Play pretend!<br /><br />Oh, I wouldn’t-<br />Oh, you did.<br /><br />Then it’s time<br />For me to bid<br /><br />You and Stanley a proper end…{% endraw %}
