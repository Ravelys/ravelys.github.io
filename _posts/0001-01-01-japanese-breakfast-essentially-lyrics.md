{% raw %}“Japanese Breakfast is back with a new single called “Essentially.” The one-off single was part of a collection of tracks recorded for W Records, the boutique record label launched by W Hotels in 2018. Past contributors to the series have included artists like Amber Mark, Perfume Genius, and Roosevelt.<br /><br />Recorded in the W Sound Suite at W Bali, the song explores the same fascination with synth-heavy dance-pop present on her 2017 album Soft Sounds From Another Planet. “I was originally going to record a different song but decided to write something on the fly once I arrived in Bali,” songwriter Michelle Zauner shared in a press release. “I like the challenge of writing and arranging quickly and intuitively sometimes, and I had just bought a Native Instruments Maschine and wanted to explore a lot of the sample libraries it came with and work on the synths that were at the studio. It was a very idyllic place to work.”” - SPIN, Rob Arcand, April 26 2019<br /><br />Stream with: <br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0nO6SoUfhavtCo0JflL3SJ?si=cNoCAQvrSVCu5VHTOz_DoA">https://open.spotify.com/album/0nO6SoUfhavtCo0JflL3SJ?si=cNoCAQvrSVCu5VHTOz_DoA</a><br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/hk/album/essentially-single/1457549211?l=en">https://itunes.apple.com/hk/album/essentially-single/1457549211?l=en</a><br /><br />Follow Japanese Breakfast: <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Jbrekkie/">https://twitter.com/Jbrekkie/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jbrekkie/">https://www.instagram.com/jbrekkie/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.facebook.com/japanesebreakfast/">https://m.facebook.com/japanesebreakfast/</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7MoIc5s9KXolCBH1fy9kkw?si=nrZeBba2S6qn8J4aIpV_yQ">https://open.spotify.com/artist/7MoIc5s9KXolCBH1fy9kkw?si=nrZeBba2S6qn8J4aIpV_yQ</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.soundcloud.com/japanesebreakfast">https://m.soundcloud.com/japanesebreakfast</a><br />bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/">https://michellezauner.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br />We apologize if we have gotten any of the lyrics wrong.<br /><br />♪ lyrics ♪ <br /><br />Ignore me sensually, I won't admit that they were right<br />Who was I to judge your brand of loneliness?<br />Who was I to think I was someone above desire?<br />Love me sexually, love me like someone else's wife<br />How is it you fall asleep so easy?<br />Who is it you're dreaming of tonight?<br /><br />How lovely essentially (Love, the thing that you can't buy)<br />Love me essentially (Hug me 'til I fill up your time)<br />Well you got it all wrong if I'd been what you're after<br />When you've got it all wrong I can't find what you want<br /><br />I lie awake to reach for the soft sound in the night<br />Try my best to swallow up the jealousy<br />Try to learn to fall hard back in love with all the sad<br /><br />Love you essentially (Love, one thing that you can't buy)<br />Love you essentially (Hug me 'til I fill up your time)<br />When you've got it all wrong I'm finally what you're after<br />I got it all wrong, I don't know what I want<br />When you've got it all wrong and don't know what you're after<br />When you've got it all wrong if I found what you want<br />______________________________________<br />Feel free to like, comment or subscribe to our channel for new uploads!<br /><br />The Tiny Majority's main focus is the promotion of underground artists of many different genres like indie rock, bedroom pop, lofi, hip-hop and more.
