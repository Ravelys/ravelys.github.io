{% raw %}First of all: Merry Christmas to Everyone!!! :-)<br />In the first instance the videos dedicated to all the great people on greysforum.de :-)<br />I know, this video's nothing special; but I wish you all a very great Christmas with it anyway.<br /><br />Yeah, I know the video doesn't have an actually storyline. But I didn't want to give it a storyline, because I just wanted it to fit to the lyrics. <br />I tried making the video basically happy and bright &amp; shiny and all - So that there'd be a bit of the Christmas Feeling in it ;-)<br /><br />But though the vid didn't turn out the way it was supposed to, I enjoyed editing it.<br />And so I hope you'll enjoy it, too. :-)<br /><br /><br /><br />Music: Sixpence Non The Richer - It Came Upon A Midnight Clear<br />Clips: From &quot;Grey's Anatomy&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />[Disclaimer: I don't own the clips, nor the song. The video is purely fanmade. No profit.<br />And if I did own Grey's Anatomy, Rose never would've been there...]{% endraw %}
