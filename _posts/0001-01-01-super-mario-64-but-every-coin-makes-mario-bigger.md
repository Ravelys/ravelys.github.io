Do I get 120 stars or maybe 16 stars? Actually, the game just crashes. Anyway, its big mario time. Like its huge mario because coins make mario grow in this super mario 64 mod. Can simply defeat the mario coin challenge? Probably not because he had been asked &quot;Can 5 Streamers Beat a World Record Speedrunner?&quot; where Mizkif, Ludwig, Atrioc, Clint Stevens, and Stanz where challenging simply to a super mario 64 relay race. But yeah, funny mario. Wow coin make mario big. Its epic. So cool.{% endraw %}
