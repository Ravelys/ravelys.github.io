{% raw %}Richley Reserve is full of history, fauna and flora. As an active mine site for over 30 years, the area has been restored to a beautiful peaceful picnic area with large grassed flats, barbeques, picnic tables and walking trails. This ideal picturesque location is part of the City of Newcastle's Blackbutt Reserve.{% endraw %}
