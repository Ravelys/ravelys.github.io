{% raw %}The Royal British Legion asked several people to read out what happened leading up to Victory in Japan 70 years ago. They were shocked to find out the truth.<br /><br />This August marks the 70th anniversary of VJ Day, commemorating the moment when Japan surrendered and brought about the end of World War Two. While the war in Europe ended in early May 1945 it continued in the Far East. The Japanese finally surrendered on 14 August 1945 following the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria. As part this VJ Day anniversary, weâ€™d like to recognise the sacrifices and pay tribute to all those who served in the Armed Forces, including those who served in the famous 14th Army in Burma, who helped secure victory. Prisoners of War and civilian internees from the conflict will also be recognised.  <br /><br />To find out more about VJ Day and upcoming event check out our:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1hnIX8b">http://bit.ly/1hnIX8b</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPoppyLegion">https://www.facebook.com/OfficialPoppyLegion</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/PoppyLegion">http://twitter.com/PoppyLegion</a>{% endraw %}
