{% raw %}Almost 20 years ago, I was in a cab going home and I was transfixed with the music I was hearing over the cab's radio.  We arrived at my address before it was over, so I paid the driver to remain until I heard the name of this work: The Protecting Veil, a work for solo cello and orchestra by Sir John Tavener.  The soloist is Stephen Isserlis and the strings of the London Symphony Orchestra are conducted by Gennadi Rozhdestvensky.  The work is 44 minutes.{% endraw %}
