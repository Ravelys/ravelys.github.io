{% raw %}130 BPM (Beats per minute) Metronome<br /><br />I designed this metronome series to be as simple and minimal as possible yet of the highest quality.<br /><br />My goal was to design a metronome with very precise time accuracy, that can be played loud to cut through loud musical situations without being annoying.<br /><br />I purposely avoid any accent, to keep this metronome versatile. As a result, it can be used for any time signature or time signature change, and offer just what is essential : A steady time reference.<br /><br />I used Ableton Live to record the sound and process it. My goal was to get the best transient possible to allow a very precise time reference while at the same time keeping the sound dense with a moderate crest factor. I crafted the frequency response of the click very carefully to avoid harsh frequencies where our ear is very sensitive.<br /><br />In order to keep this metronome lightweight, i decided to avoid any animation that can distract the attention of the musician.<br /><br />This metronome is great for personal practice, in particular for drums, percussions or electrical instruments where some metronomes struggle to be heard but can be used by teachers or schools providing a solution for classrooms, where the loudness and size of a real metronome are just not good enough.<br /><br />That's all, I hope you'll enjoy this series.<br /><br />The Complete Series - 001 to 600 BPM :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5wYPwL6FJKfmdkkcmV_1eP6QiW97_N8_">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5wYPwL6FJKfmdkkcmV_1eP6QiW97_N8_</a><br /><br /><br />metronome - metronoom - metronom<br />метраном - метроном - metrònom<br />metrónomo - metronomi - metrónomo<br />μετρονόμος - metronóm - metronomo<br />metronoms - metronomas - métronome<br />máy nhịp - মাত্রামাপক - 节拍器 - 節拍器 - 메트로놈<br />ताल-मापनी - メトロノーム - ತಾಳಯಂತ್ರ - മെട്രോനോം<br />उलटया लंबकावर नियंत्रित असलेले ठेका धरणारे यंत्र<br />சாதனத்தை - เครื่องเมตรอนอม<br />بندول الايقاع - מֶטרוֹנוֹם - میزانه شمار - מעטראָנאָמע{% endraw %}
