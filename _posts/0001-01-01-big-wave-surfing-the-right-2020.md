{% raw %}Big wave surfing The Right (2020)<br /><br />big wave surfing has progressed so far in a few short years. Big Wave spots like The Right are well known. 2020 has been a slow year in western Australia but luckily i was able to sneak down and score a few waves a few weeks ago.  <br />The Right is such a unique wave and the light you get there is amazing. this session was pretty epic for light just wish the swell was twice the size.{% endraw %}
