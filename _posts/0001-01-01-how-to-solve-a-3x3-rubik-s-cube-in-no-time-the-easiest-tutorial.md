{% raw %}üí° Bright Side now has MERCH! (And it's open globally!) Check it out at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2OJubyA">http://bit.ly/2OJubyA</a><br /><br />If you look up the word ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù in the dictionary, you‚Äôll probably see a picture of a Rubik‚Äôs Cube. It takes some bright minds only 5 seconds to solve, yet others spend years trying to put it together, eventually giving up. But the truth is that anyone can solve the Rubik‚Äôs Cube with one single algorithm! And it‚Äôs really simple! <br /><br />So, today's algorithm includes 7 stages. You can pause the video and practice until you can do all these moves pretty much automatically. It‚Äôll help you later on!<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />15 Puzzles That Will Keep You Up All Night <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugAUMbceVNU&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugAUMbceVNU&amp;</a><br />10 Detective Riddles Only the Most Attentive 1% Can Solve <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fIaUK1fQwA&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fIaUK1fQwA&amp;</a><br />Only the Most Attentive 4% Will Pass This Test <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtbXPdCEhPk&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtbXPdCEhPk&amp;</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />#1.

The task here is to put together a white cross, and align its edges with the right colored center on each side.<br />- #2. At this stage, you‚Äôll have to put the lower corners of the cube in the right places, and the white side of the cube will be solved. Here‚Äôs where you‚Äôll use that R U R‚Äô U‚Äô algorithm for your right hand. <br />- #3. At this stage, you‚Äôll need to solve the rest of the middle layer so that the outer blocks are the same color as the center. In the first case, the layer you‚Äôll be working with is to the LEFT on the top of the target position. You must match it with the right color. <br />- #4. First, you put together a yellow cross on the yellow side of the cube. If you don‚Äôt see the yellow line but only a random set of yellow edges, start doing the algorithm. As soon as you see the yellow line, start doing the same algorithm!<br />- #5. Now we need to arrange the edges of the yellow cross so that the second color coincides with the color of that side.<br />- #6. At this stage, the task is to put the corners in place with the appropriate colors of neighboring centers. You only need to move them into place ‚Äì you‚Äôre not solving them just yet.<br />- #7. You‚Äôre almost done! All you have to do is solve the corners! Use the algorithm you already know in a slightly modified order until the corner is solved. <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br />East News<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
