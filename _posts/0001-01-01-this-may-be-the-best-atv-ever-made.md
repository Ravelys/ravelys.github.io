{% raw %}Ultimate 4x4 part 1<br />Like many have this year, I got the itch to buy myself a new ATV. I wanted a go-anywhere-4x4, but which one do I think deserves my hard-earned money, and which ATV can I make into my Ultimate 4x4? My choice is a no-brainer, it's the Yamaha Grizzly EPS SE. Here's why I chose what just may be the best ATV ever made, the Yamaha Grizzly. <br /><br />This is part 1 of my new “Ultimate 4x4” video series. From cross country racing, GNCC competition, work-duties in the yard, trail-riding with buddies to a 4000 mile coast-to-coast trip on the Trans American Trail – the Yamaha Grizzly does it all.<br /><br />My Ultimate 4x4 Upgrades for the Yamaha Grizzly (List in Progress):<br />Plastic Glide Plate (Genuine Yamaha Accessory):<br />PN: B16-F84N0-V0-00<br /><br />Rear Grab Bar (Genuine Yamaha Accessory):<br />PN: B4F-F85E0-V0-00<br /><br />Front Brush Guard/Bumper (Genuine Yamaha Accessory):<br />PN: B4F-F84L0-V0-00 <br /><br />Yorwe Anti-Slip Grip Tape:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3m4X03C">https://amzn.to/3m4X03C</a><br /><br />3M Super 77 Spray Adhesive:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VWq6Y1">https://amzn.to/2VWq6Y1</a><br /><br />XCEL Neoprene Foam Handlebar Padding:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2K8UGuP">https://amzn.to/2K8UGuP</a><br /><br />Music used in this video:<br />Put your Money on Me, Arcade Fire: youtube.com/watch?v=dHC6I7v-1Pc<br />Tuff Enuff, Fabulous Thunderbirds: youtube.com/watch?v=EcXT1clXc04{% endraw %}
