Captured in a single, animated time lapsed shot, and based on archeological findings, we trace our epic journey from the first spark of life billions of years ago up to our present status as the most successful species on the planet.  Humans are the pinnacle of a chain of species that has survived by way of evolution, natural selection, adaptation, and pure luck.  From the formation of primordial genetic material to the development of speech, this is the improbable story of the incredible set of circumstances that led to human existence.<br /><br />This documentary aims to answer such questions as:  How did we get here?  How did mutations create male and female sexes?  And were we actually fish at one point during the evolutionary chain?<br /><br />We are the most complex creature on this planet, a big brained, two-legged mammal.  Weâ€™ve risen from the raw materials of the Earth to dominate and shape it.  Wind the clock backwards and the story of how we got to be us is a puzzle that defies all logic.  Through nearly 4 billion years of evolutionary twists and turns, disasters strike, predators threaten to wipe us out.  From rodent to reptile, we face extinction at every turn, from the land into the water, fighting to survive every step of the way, from fish to worm, back to the very first spark of life, to a single simple cell.  One change or predator along the way and this extraordinary story would have never been told.{% endraw %}
