{% raw %}SCP 577 is a Euclid Class anomaly also known as Bullet Cat.<br /><br />SCP-577 is an animated, levitating mass of ammunition of various calibers, that persistently spins in a spherical formation. Bullets within SCP577 are capable of leaving the mass and firing at speeds comparable to those from a standard handgun. Occasionally, the mass has been observed forming recognizable shapes and likenesses, commonly those of domestic animals. <br /><br />SCP-577 is exceptionally aggressive towards all Foundation staff and D-Class who have a background in law enforcement. A large amount of its mass will fire towards these staff members, resulting in physical injury and occasionally death. However, research has found that SCP-577 acts friendly towards a small number of D-Class, typically those taken from the US prison and homeless populations.<br /><br />LIKE &amp; SUBSCRIBE to SCP Explained - Story &amp; Animation<br /><br />Watch these other SCP videos we love:<br /><br />SCP-066 - Eric's Toy (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuMoD0qdBDw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuMoD0qdBDw</a><br /><br />SCP-662 - Butler's Hand Bell (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3_EM0Ac1Zc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3_EM0Ac1Zc</a><br /><br />SCP-3999 - I Am At The Center of Everything That Happens To Me (SCP Animation)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB_tAn_K6SU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB_tAn_K6SU</a><br /><br />SCP-939 With Many Voices (SCP Animation) by TheRubber<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNp1_pumF_E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNp1_pumF_E</a><br /><br />SCP-682 Indestructible Creature (SCP Animated) by TheRubber<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGt63SML_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGt63SML_8</a><br /><br />SCP-173 The Sculpture (SCP Animated) by TheRubber<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E551zXZLJM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E551zXZLJM</a><br /><br />Join our Discord, share your SCP art, submit video feedback, chat with other fans...: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/scp">https://discord.gg/scp</a><br /><br />Please let us know in the comments which SCP's we should cover next <br /><br />Narrated by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/hitherehunter">https://www.youtube.com/c/hitherehunter</a><br /><br />Content relating to the SCP Foundation, including the SCP Foundation logo, is licensed under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0 and all concepts originate from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net">http://www.scp-wiki.net</a> and its authors. <br /><br />SCP-577 - Bullet Cat (SCP Animation) is based on &quot;SCP-577&quot; by MayD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-577">https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-577</a><br /><br />#scpexplained #scp #animation{% endraw %}
