{% raw %}The Complex Sneakers Podcast is co-hosted by Joe La Puma, Brendan Dunne, and Matt Welty. In this week's episode, the trio is joined by Bernie Gross, creative director at New York sneaker boutique Extra Butter. Gross recalls his journey in the footwear industry, from buying SBs at stores like Special Sauce in Long Island to helping longstanding LI sneaker shop Renarts establish itself anew with Extra Butter. He breaks down what running a sneaker store really takesâ€”from handling chaotic releases to managing relationships with brand partners and collaborators. Also, the co-hosts discuss the merits of beat sneakers: When is it time to throw your old shoes out? How much wear is too much wear? Can a pair of Air Force 1s that spent a year in the Armenian mountains go any further?<br /><br />EPISODE CHAPTERS / TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:00 - Start of episode. <br />10:00 - Brendan talks about getting into Formula 1 racing, Welty talks about being into F1 as a kid.<br />20:00 - The guys talk about their favorite cooked sneakers. <br />27:13 - Bernie Gross, guest of the week joins the show. <br />40:00 - Bernie Gross talks about being mentored by Pete in the retail business and now mentoring the youth. <br />47:44 - Bernie talks all his inspired custom sneakers at Extra Butter. <br />55:52 - Bernie talks working at Sneaker News. <br />1:01:00 - Bernie opens up about the unwelcoming vibe he got once he opened up in LES. <br />1:10:00 - Bernie talks about the future of communicating and connecting with the younger sneaker enthusiasts. <br />1:20:00 - Bernie tells stories about hosting Rick Ross' activation in the Extra Butter store. <br />1:26:03 - Guys talk Extra Butter designed a dunk for Special Sauce that never dropped. <br />1:28:29 - End of episode. <br /><br />Enter for next week's sneaker giveaway here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ebay.complex.com/">https://ebay.complex.com/</a><br /><br />Looking for the Complex Sneakers Podcast Dad Hats?
