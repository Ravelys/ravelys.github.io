{% raw %}A Suitable Girl follows three young women in India struggling to maintain their identities and follow their dreams amid intense pressure to get married. Ritu, Dipti and Amrita represent the new India. Educated, financially stable and raised with a mix of traditional and contemporary values in the urban cities of Mumbai and New Delhi, they have access to the world in ways their mothers did not. Yet their lives take a dramatic turn when the pressure to settle down and get married hits. Career aspirations become secondary to the pursuit of a husband, and the women struggle with the prospect of leaving their homes and families to become part of another.<br /><br />Directed By:  Sarita Khurana  &amp; Smriti Mundhra<br />Producers: Jennifer Tiexiera, Sarita Khurana<br />Produced By: Smriti Mundhra<br /><br />Film Pulse:<br />web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://filmpulse.net">http://filmpulse.net</a><br />twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/filmpulsenet">http://twitter.com/filmpulsenet</a><br />facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/filmpulse">http://facebook.com/filmpulse</a><br />patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/filmpulse">http://patreon.com/filmpulse</a>{% endraw %}
