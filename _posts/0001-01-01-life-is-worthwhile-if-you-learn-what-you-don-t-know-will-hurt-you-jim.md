{% raw %}First, life is worthwhile if you LEARN. What you don't know WILL hurt you. You have to have learning to exist, let alone succeed.<br /><br />Four powerful little words: learn, try, stay, and care. What difference can you make in your life today by putting these four words to work?<br /><br />We learn by what we see - pay attention. By what we hear – be a good listener. Now I do suggest being a selective listener, don't just let anybody dump into your mental factory. We learn from what we read. Learn from every source. Learn from lectures, learn from songs, learn from sermons, learn from conversations with people who care. Keep learning.<br /><br />Don't forget to share, to motivate, and inspire other people!<br /><br />*CREDIT<br />Jim Rohn<br />Visit Jim Rohn's websites:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jimrohn.com/">https://www.jimrohn.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.jimrohn.com/">https://store.jimrohn.com/</a><br /><br />Follow Jim Rohn @:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJimRohn">https://www.facebook.com/OfficialJimRohn</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OfficialJimRohn">https://twitter.com/OfficialJimRohn</a><br /><br />Music I Am a Man Who Will Fight for Your Honor by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/honor/">http://chriszabriskie.com/honor/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chriszabriskie.com/">http://chriszabriskie.com/</a><br /><br />Get 30 days FREE Ultimate Jim Rohn Audiobook Library: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dSF88M">https://amzn.to/3dSF88M</a><br /><br />Get 7-Day Free Access to Mindvalley: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3k5OD90">https://bit.ly/3k5OD90</a><br /><br />Mindvalley Membership gives you access to the Best of Mindvalley.
