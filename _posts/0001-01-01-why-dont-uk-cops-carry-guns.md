{% raw %}Why don’t UK cops carry guns?<br /><br />Most use non-lethal tools like batons, handcuffs, and mace.<br /><br />This is because the Metropolitan Police was founded on“policing by consent” - and they worry that guns sabotage that. <br /><br />Less than ten percent of UK officers carry guns. In a year-long period up to March 2016, only seven shots were fired in England and Wales. <br /><br />And a poll of officers showed 82% wanted to keep it that way.{% endraw %}
