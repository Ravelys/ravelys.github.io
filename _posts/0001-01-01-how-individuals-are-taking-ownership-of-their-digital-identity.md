{% raw %}Julie Esser, CULedger &amp; Drummond Reed, Evernym<br /><br />Consumers have become hypersensitive to the way their digital identities are used and what data is shared with even the most trusted sources – including their financial institution. Instead of waiting for a crisis, the distributed ledger is taking action to provide consumers with the most secure digital identity developed: self-sovereign identification (SSI).<br />SSI is a global digital identifier built on a distributed ledger platform that permits members to securely interact with their credit union. By giving individuals control over their personal identifiable information, SSI can create a truly secure and privacy-preserving flow of information.<br />During this session, learn from CULedger, about the benefits of SSI, the security measures it will provide to protect digital identities and how organizations should leverage the technology to gain their users’ trust.{% endraw %}
