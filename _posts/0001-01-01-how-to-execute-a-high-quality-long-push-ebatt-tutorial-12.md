{% raw %}eBaTT - Table Tennis Tutorial - P1 April 2019 (How to execute a quality Long Push),<br />The Exercise:<br />Long Push, A relatively simple strong to execute but hard to deliver at a high level consistently. The aim is to get the stroke technically correct and impart a good amount of backspin which elevates the pressure on your opponent. The long push can be executed on any short ball especially backspin. This stroke puts your opponent under pressure; can cause them to miss or deliver a slow ball which allows you to take command over the rally.<br /><br />The Aim:<br />1. Produce backspin and float with a similar-looking stroke, <br />2. Develop the correct technique (hacking motion)<br />3.

The technique, hacking motions, and a follow-through stroke<br /><br />For more sources regarding table tennis coaching<br />please visit my website:<br /><br />www.eBaTT.co.uk<br /><br />or visit my social media platforms: <br />Facebook: EBATT<br />twitter: @elibaraty<br />Instagram: _eBaTT<br /><br />And please don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel to receive our two coaching video tips every month, published on the 1st and 15th.
