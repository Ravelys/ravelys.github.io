{% raw %}Reggae/Dancehall entertainer Yaktsa releases a captivating new single ‘Ambition’ which is now available on all digital platforms. This uplifting and encouraging track, speaks to building generational wealth and how important it is to not seek validation from the public but to focus on the more valuable aspects of life.  <br /> <br />Yaksta says, “in today, as a society we focus more on the flashy material things and what is more expensive. I am standing from a different viewpoint; I believe that building generational wealth and focusing less on the expensive materials are steps in the right direction. This is for young and the young at heart”. Yaksta noted that the track is to build awareness and for his fans to shift focus, as the song is a movement in a bright direction.  <br /> <br />The track, which was produced by Afro Boi Entertainment and WussMuzikk, is the first track off the compilation featuring other artists, titled (Africans for Africa) set to release later this year. It was composed, by Marlon Easy. Ambition is available on digital platforms Spotify, Deezer, YouTube, Vevo channel, Amazon Music and on Itunes. <br /> <br />Yaksta hopes to see a major shift in consciousness with music that creates unity and inspires all.    <br /><br />►Subscribe to Official Yaksta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGvCAuJkk58UWc0n-Clm5A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGvCAuJkk58UWc0n-Clm5A</a><br /><br />►Follow Official Yaksta:<br />Website: www.Yakstamusic.com<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/OfficialYaksta">https://www.instagram.com/OfficialYaksta</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Yaksta1618/">https://www.facebook.com/Yaksta1618/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/yakstacarvanie">https://twitter.com/yakstacarvanie</a><br />Stream on Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/yaksta_carvanie">https://soundcloud.com/yaksta_carvanie</a><br />Stream on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5vtwMQzntImyhUesG7tt2n?si=mcAuEReoQOWEabJQBAfV1g">https://open.spotify.com/artist/5vtwMQzntImyhUesG7tt2n?si=mcAuEReoQOWEabJQBAfV1g</a><br />Stream on Audiomack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audiomack.com/officialyaksta">https://audiomack.com/officialyaksta</a><br /><br />Official Lyrics<br /> <br />Yaksta, uh-huh, Yeah! <br />Two oh! two two, Bush Lord ah<br />Ready Marlon?
