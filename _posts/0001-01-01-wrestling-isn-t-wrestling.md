{% raw %}A somewhat-mostly-accurate educational parody film by Max Landis.<br /><br />This production is not monetized, and not for profit.  The clips used herein are used with direct reference, as critique, and the characters and situations depicted are for the purpose of satire.<br /><br />Yes, I know I got some things out of order.  It was condensed and simplified and told from memory.  Did you honestly want this to be an hour long?  You didn’t.  I didn’t.  Let’s be real with each other.  Real respects real.  I respect you.<br /><br />Ron Howard was gonna be in this one too, but he was in Budapest.  He’s wracked with guilt and remorse.<br /><br /><br />Production --<br />Producer -- Max Landis<br />Producer -- Shyam Sundar Sengupta<br />Producer -- Matt Cohen<br />Producer -- Dave Holton<br /><br />Director's Unit --<br />Director -- Max Landis<br />1st AD -- Dave Holton<br />PA -- Christopher Pollock<br /><br />Camera Department --<br />Director of Photography/AC -- Stephen Sorace<br />Director of Photography -- Ross Reige<br />Director of Photography/AC -- Cory Braun<br />Director of Photography -- Jamie Hall<br />AC -- Daniel Beldy<br />Additional Camera  -- Ryan Aylsworth<br /><br />Art Department --<br />Production Designer -- Marisa Gerardin<br />Art Director -- Ricardo Orta<br /><br />Costume Designer -- Jade Thompson<br />Costume Designer -- Michelle Rose<br />Costume Designer -- Natasha Parkinn<br />Costume Special Thanks -- Five Second Films<br />Art Dept Help -- Rebecca Rowley<br />Art Dept Help -- Maggie Levin<br />Art Dept Help -- Michelle Kruse<br />Art Dept Help -- Jeff Cancinos<br />Art Dept Help -- Jason Weiss<br />Art Dept Help -- Jody Steel<br />Art Dept Help -- Charlie Fray<br /><br />Make Up --<br />MUA -- Elise Simone<br />MUA -- Chrissy Lynn<br />MUA -- Jade Martinez<br />Hair Special Thanks  -- Cornrows by Misty<br /><br />Post Production --<br />Editor -- Andy Holton<br />VFX Supervisor -- Mike Dahlquist<br />Composer -- Evan Goldman<br />Composer -- Calvin Markus<br />Composer -- Chris Ranier<br />Sound Design &amp; Mixing -- Lindsey Alvarez<br />Color Grading -- Andrew Schwartz <br /><br />Additional Music by<br />Title Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>{% endraw %}
