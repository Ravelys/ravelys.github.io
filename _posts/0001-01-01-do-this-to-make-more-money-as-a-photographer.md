{% raw %}Every photographer wants to make money taking photos. Not many actually pull it off.

Once you've got that down, it's simply a matter of selecting which methods are most appropriate for your style of photography and your type of client. Choose one or apply all 6!<br /><br />At the end of the day, the worst way to make more money with photography is by lowering your prices. Yes, you might book more clients, but in the end you wind up kicking yourself because you're doing more photoshoots for less money, rather than getting less clients but making the same amount of money for a whole lot less photography. <br /><br />If these tips were helpful, leave a comment below with how you'll be applying them to your business!<br /><br />#photographymarketing #makemoneywithphotography #photographybusiness #photographytutorials<br /><br /><br />*GET MORE CLIENTS* <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.signatureedits.com/marketing-branding-membership">https://shop.signatureedits.com/marketing-branding-membership</a><br /><br />*FREE MARKETING TEMPLATES* <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.signatureedits.com/free-branding-bundle">https://shop.signatureedits.com/free-branding-bundle</a><br /><br />ðŸ“¸ My current photography gear:<br /><br />Panasonic S1- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39SczqO">https://amzn.to/39SczqO</a><br /><br />Sigma Art 35mm 1.4 L mount - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3i1SGAc">https://amzn.to/3i1SGAc</a><br /><br />Panasonic Lumix 24-105 f4 L mount - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3grgQ6U">https://amzn.to/3grgQ6U</a><br /><br />YONGNUO YN-560 IV Flash - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DAsZI4">https://amzn.to/2DAsZI4</a><br /><br />ðŸ–¥ Computer Editing Setup =<br /><br />2019 27&quot; imac upgraded with 40gb of ram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3i3Vk8I">https://amzn.to/3i3Vk8I</a><br /><br />When I'm working away from home, I use a 2015 15&quot; macbook pro with 16gb of ram - So you don't NEED the brand new fancy computer... It just speeds up the performance and snappiness of Lightroom so you're not waiting so long for previews to load or images to export etc.<br /><br />Recommended laptop: ðŸ’» 13 inch M1 Macbook Pro $1249 USD <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=signatureedit-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=signatureedit-20</a><br /><br />The new M1 Macbook Air and M1 Macbook Pros are AMAZING for photo editing and Lightroom Performance, even with their base model options With the new M1 macbooks, 8gb RAM works. With any other machine, I'd recommend going with at least 16gb of ram and 512gb of storage if you can swing it.<br /><br />OR grab the new M1 PRO 14 or 16 inch Macbook Pro for even more insane performance... But they're also $500-$1000 more cash, so for most people the M1 macbook air is STILL the best choice{% endraw %}
