{% raw %}The alligator pepper is the seed of a plant contained in a fruit in form of a small pod. The seeds are very tiny and many of them are contained in a pod which usually looks like a husk because it's usually dry. The alligator pepper is used for purification and cleansing, both from uncleanness and negative energy{% endraw %}
