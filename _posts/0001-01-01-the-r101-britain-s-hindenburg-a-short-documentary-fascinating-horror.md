{% raw %}On the 5th of October, 1930, a passenger airship crashed to the ground and burst into flame, killing almost everyone on board. It wasn’t the Hindenburg. Instead, this was the R101 – an experimental British airship on its first overseas voyage. The conception, creation and testing of the R101 had been a fraught process… and its tragic end would be the death knell of the British airship industry.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:41 - History and Context<br />07:40 - The R101 Crash<br />09:56 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past.
