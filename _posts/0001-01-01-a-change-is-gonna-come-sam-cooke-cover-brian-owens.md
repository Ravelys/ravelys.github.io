These qualities radiate from all of his work, including his duet with five time Grammy-winning and legendary vocalist Michael McDonald on SOUL OF FERGUSON, and the heartfelt interpretation of Sam Cooke's &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come,&quot; which Owens filmed and recorded with his father, Thomas Owens. Their powerful performance ignited the internet and has received more than 100 million views on Facebook and YouTube. Owens and McDonald appear as featured guests on an episode of SANBORN SESSIONS, hosted by award-winning saxophonist, composer and arranger David Sanborn from his home studio in New York. Additionally, Owens serves as the Community Music Artist in Residence with the E. Desmond Lee Fine Arts Collaborative at the University of Missouri St. Louis.
