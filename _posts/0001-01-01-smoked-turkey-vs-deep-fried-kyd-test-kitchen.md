(Plus, we end up with pre-leftovers for our boys' endless appetites.) We've heard there is nothing better than a deep-fried turkey, and this was the perfect time to give it a try! As long as we were testing turkeys, we decided to smoke a turkey too and compare the results. Check out the video to find out which one we liked best! Also, it's good to be smoking meat again. When we didn't have a smoker, we missed it big time. It's amazing that the simplest way to cook can also have the most flavor. Too good to be true! Our old smoker gave up on us during SN9, and that's when Chef Greg with Recteq reached out to save the day. Greg follows KYD and has a sweet 5th wheel setup. We've been smoking food every night since we set up the RT-1250, and have more plans for using it on the road!<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è KYD Insiders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream">https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream</a> <br />Join the most supportive and genuine RV community ever.
