{% raw %}CRAZY TRICKS THAT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER<br /><br /><br /><br />No need to waste your time trying to find a solution to your daily problems. Today I show you some cool hacks satisfying clips you’ll love trying. <br /><br />If you have a splinter, warm up a small glass and then place it on your skin. It will create suction and it will lift the splinter out of your skin. <br /><br />If you got a cut on your hand, you can cover with the skin from an eggshell. <br /><br />To help yourself get over the flu, take a slice of onion and add it in your socks. Your body will absorb the sulfuric compounds and help you get over the cold faster. <br /><br />If you have a runny nose, eat one ice-cube and press it against your palate. <br /><br />I also show you a few body hacks to understand important measurements in our bodies. <br /><br />For example, the size of your forearm is the same size as your feet. And, one single hair can hold a pair of scissors. <br /><br />If you keep bringing your head forward and leaning down because you’re constantly on your phone, it will ruin your posture, so it’s important to follow my exercises and stretches. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Timestamps: <br /><br />0:23 – First aid for home<br /><br />2:56 – How to cure a runny nose<br /><br />5:46 – Anti stress technique<br /><br />8:02 – How to cure a toothache<br /><br />10:23 – Get rid of sweat stains<br /><br />12:59 – How to stop feeling tired <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
