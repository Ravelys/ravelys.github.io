The goal is to get you up to speed with some of the terminology and to give you a better understanding of what robust control is and how it fits into the larger control field.<br /><br />A system is robust if it’s capable of meeting requirements (usually stability or performance measures) even in the presence of model or disturbance uncertainty. Basically, it’s being able to say, I don’t know my system perfectly or the environment it’s going to operate within, but I’m confident it’s going to work!<br /><br />And robust control theory is how we get that confidence. It’s a method or an approach that we can use to design a system in a way that can handle uncertainty.<br /><br />In this first video, we put some intuition behind these definitions.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Get a free product trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ZHFb5u">https://goo.gl/ZHFb5u</a><br />Learn more about MATLAB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/8QV7ZZ">https://goo.gl/8QV7ZZ</a><br />Learn more about Simulink: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nqnbLe">https://goo.gl/nqnbLe</a><br />See what's new in MATLAB and Simulink: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/pgGtod">https://goo.gl/pgGtod</a><br /><br />© 2020 The MathWorks, Inc.
