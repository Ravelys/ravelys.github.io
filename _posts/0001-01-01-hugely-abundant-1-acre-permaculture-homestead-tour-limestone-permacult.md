{% raw %}Watch the first tour we did back in 2015! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jSNc13cmknE">https://youtu.be/jSNc13cmknE</a><br /><br />In Episode 3 of Permaculture Tours we revisit the amazing Limestone Permaculture Farm. in NSW, Australia. We first visited Limestone back in 2015, when Brett and Nici were five years into developing their 1-acre permaculture property, working full time off-farm and creating their piece of paradise in their spare time.<br /><br />This revisit film was shot in October 2019 – four years on, Brett and Nici are full time at home, teaching permaculture and homesteading, offering farm tours, selling produce and thriving despite a severe drought and encroaching bushfires.<br /><br />Brett gives us a tour of the property, showing how things have changed and developed since we last visited, and Brett and Nici describe the motivation behind all their hard work.<br /><br />In a couple of weeks we’ll be making a podcast episode with Brett and Nici to talk about how they fared during Australia’s horrific 2019-20 bushfire season, their farm’s resilience to drought and more.
