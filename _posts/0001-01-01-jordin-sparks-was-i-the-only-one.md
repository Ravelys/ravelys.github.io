{% raw %}Mmmm.<br />When you told me that I was a star in the sky,<br />Baby I believed every word.<br />And you seemed so sincere,<br />It was perfectly clear,<br />Cause forever was all that I heard.<br />And every little kiss,<br />From your tender lips,<br />Couldn't of been a lie.<br />I fell hard over head,<br />Without a safety net,<br />And I don't understand this goodbye.<br /><br />Was I the only one who fell in love?<br />There never really was the two of us.<br />And maybe my all just wasn't good enough.<br />Was I the only one, only one, in love?<br /><br />As I walk down the hall,<br />See the place on the wall,<br />Where the picture of us used to be.<br />I fight back those tears, cause I still feel you here.<br />How could you walk out so easily?<br />And I don't understand, how I can feel this pain, and still be alive.<br />And all these broken dreams,<br />And all these memories,<br />Are killing me inside.<br /><br />Was I the only one who fell in love?<br />There never really was the two of us.<br />And maybe my all just wasn't good enough.<br />Was I the only one, only one,<br />Tell me, what I'm supposed to do with all this love?<br />Baby, it was supposed to be the two of us.<br />Help me, cause I still don't want to believe.<br /><br />I was the only one.<br />I was the only one.<br />I the only one who fell in love.<br />There never really was the two of us, hey.<br />And maybe my all just wasn't good enough.<br />I the only one, the only one.<br />I the only one who fell in love.<br />There never really was the two of us.<br />And maybe my all just wasn't good enough.<br />Was I the only one, the only one, in love?<br /><br />When you told me that I was a star in the sky,<br />Baby I believed every word{% endraw %}
