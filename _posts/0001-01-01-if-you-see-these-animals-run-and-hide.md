{% raw %}The world is full of fantastic animals and bugs that fascinate us. There are even petting zoos built to satisfy our need to touch and pet everything we see. But, we also have to keep in mind volution’s best work, poisonous and venomous animals. There are some species that should be avoided at all costs. Some of them, like the box jellyfish, are so powerful that they can potentially kill us! Even nature’s weirdos, like the platypus, have enough poison in them to leave their opponent paralyzed for hours. And there are species whose poisons we have no cure for, like our number one! Here is a list of animals that, if you see, you should run and HIDE!<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “10 Sweetest Animals That Are Secretly Killers”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/K1vGZiUQkLU">https://youtu.be/K1vGZiUQkLU</a><br />Watch our “10 Animals You Should Never Touch”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/L2pCwbmMIdg">https://youtu.be/L2pCwbmMIdg</a><br />Watch our “10 CUTEST Animals You Should NEVER Touch”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OXa_htQFP6k">https://youtu.be/OXa_htQFP6k</a> <br /><br />Poison dart frog<br /><br />When an animal has the word “poison” in its name, you already know that you should stay away from them. But the poison dart frog isn’t just one frog. It’s a whole diverse ground of brightly colored frogs that you just want to pet. But you should actually do the opposite when you see them. Even though they’re about the size of a paper clip, they have enough poison in them to kill 10 human adults! <br /><br />The poison they harbor is called batrachotoxin, and the worst part is that their poison gland is located right under their skin. So just touching them can lead to certain death. But the indigenous Embera people used this quality of theirs for their own good. They’ve been lacing the tip of their arrows with this frog’s toxin to protect themselves from any sort of danger. Pretty smart if you ask us!<br /><br />Puss moth<br /><br />Moths come in all shapes and sizes, and sometimes they’re even prettier than butterflies! The puss moth, which gets its name because of its resemblance to a cat, looks like something you just desperately want to pet. However, this fur is more than just looks. The larva’s fur has a secret set of spikes that are just waiting to prick someone and kill them! As soon as you get stung, that area starts to hurt, and from then onwards, the pain only gets worse. <br /><br />The victim would feel intense throbbing pain, burning, and even a rash. Many patients can experience swelling, nausea, abdominal pain, shock, and even respiratory distress. Luckily, the wound pain lessens within an hour and the rash also goes away in a day. All you need to do is clean the sting with some soap and water and then use an ice pack to cool it down.<br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
