Please only learn it if you like it and if you are interested in learning it. I do not believe there is one ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù accent or manner of pronunciation and I fully encourage EFL/ESL learners to expose themselves to as many varieties of English around the world to become accustomed to the beautiful variations of this world language. I focus mostly on teaching ‚ÄúModern RP‚Äù (I may just say ‚ÄúRP‚Äù in my older videos, but to clarify, I do specifically mean ‚ÄúModern RP‚Äù), however, you will hear a lovely little Yorkshire twang to my accent from time to time too. Please LOVE and BE PROUD of your accent. After all, it is part of your identity and makes you unique. üíö<br /><br />#englishpronunciation #pronunciation #minimalpairs{% endraw %}
