{% raw %}We get a lot of requests from people who want to know if their loved one has autism. Sometimes it helps to hear reasons they do not have autism. Even though we've covered similar ground in the past, when things are heard in the opposite way, the brain can form new connections and thoughts can click into place more easily. [EDIT]: We have a follow up video based on a lot of questions we received to this one. We cover things like Autism being a spectrum, masking, mis-diagnosis and under-diagnosing, etc. You can click the video link just below this sentence, thanks! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0iUVMl9htE&amp;lc=UgxNLAPvZloK_rKQMtt4AaABAg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0iUVMl9htE&amp;lc=UgxNLAPvZloK_rKQMtt4AaABAg</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/autismfamily">https://www.patreon.com/autismfamily</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Autism-Family-Youtube-107318891102628?view_public_for=107318891102628">https://www.facebook.com/Autism-Family-Youtube-107318891102628?view_public_for=107318891102628</a>{% endraw %}
