{% raw %}Movie : The Great Gatsby<br />Artist : Lana Del Rey<br />Song : Young and Beautiful<br /><br />Lyrics :<br /><br />I've seen the world<br />Done it all, had my cake now<br />Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now<br />Hot summer nights mid July<br />When you and I were forever wild<br />The crazy days, the city lights<br />The way you'd play with me like a child<br /><br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful<br />Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul<br />I know you will, I know you will<br />I know that you will<br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful<br /><br />I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now<br />Channeling angels in, the new age now<br />Hot summer days, rock and roll<br />The way you'd play for me at your show<br />And all the ways I got to know<br />Your pretty face and electric soul<br /><br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful<br />Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul<br />I know you will, I know you will<br />I know that you will<br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful<br /><br />Dear lord when I get to heaven<br />Please let me bring my man<br />When he comes tell me that you'll let him in<br />Father tell me if you can<br /><br />Oh that grace, oh that body<br />Oh that face makes me wanna party<br />He's my sun, he makes shine like diamonds<br /><br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful<br />Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul<br />I know you will, I know you will<br />I know that you will<br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful<br />Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful<br />Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful{% endraw %}
