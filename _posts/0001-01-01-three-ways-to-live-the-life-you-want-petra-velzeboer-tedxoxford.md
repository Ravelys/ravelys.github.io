{% raw %}Psychotherapist, CEO and Cult Survivor, Petra Velzeboer, talks us through the steps necessary to sort yourself out so you can live the life you want no matter what lies in your past. A brave new world is one free of excuses and blame. When the temptation is bigger than ever to blame the world around us, our work environments, governments or health for the ills in our life, Petra talks through the opportunity within all of these circumstances to practice bravery and see this time as a training ground that allows us to practice conscious thought and build up the life we want. No excuses. Petra is a mental health consultant, psychotherapist, training provider, executive coach, and much more. Currently, she runs a mental health consultancy that strives to create mentally healthy workplaces by training organisations and leaders in their awareness of mental health and advising on the best strategies to deal with it. Raised in a cult, Petraâ€™s story is one of courage in the face of adversity. She believes in utilising empathy and human connection to create safe workplaces which will ultimately enhance productivity. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
