{% raw %}Just like anything<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> Is a state of mind<br /><br /> Sunlight dances slowly on a drum beats broken rhyme<br /><br /> I speak in answers only to see them in my mind<br /><br /> If I had a penny I'd throw it in the sea<br /><br /> to see if would float away<br /><br /> Or grow of any tree<br /><br /> I play the fool of rhythm<br /><br /> To speak of what is sane<br /><br /> I never think of singing to those who feel the same<br /><br /> See how high the rain falls<br /><br /> See the color in my hair<br /><br /> Hunt for golden pourage bowls<br /><br /> Hear the paper tear<br /><br /> Just like anything<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> Is a state of mind<br /><br /> Death gives no reason<br /><br /> So why should I<br /><br /> Death has no season<br /><br /> So I know I'll never die<br /><br /> Just like anything<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> To sing<br /><br /> Is a state of mind{% endraw %}
