{% raw %}Although i had the incredible good fortune to swim in the warm sea off Portugal this week we are very aware that winter is coming so insulation and reparation is essential at this crucial time. <br />I have been getting the ceilings insulated and vaulted and trying to work out some form of heating that is not too costly and some form of internal hot water...<br />Its all coming thick and fast but luckily we have beautiful friends and neighbours to help us along the way. <br />Thank you so much for watching and supporting our journey in whatever way you can, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. <br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=49424292">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=49424292</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/DestinoPortugal">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/DestinoPortugal</a>{% endraw %}
