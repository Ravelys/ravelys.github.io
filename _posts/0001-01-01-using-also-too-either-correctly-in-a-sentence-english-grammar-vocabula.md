{% raw %}Using 'Also' , 'Too' &amp; 'Either' correctly in a sentence - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.letstalkpodcast.com">http://www.letstalkpodcast.com</a><br /><br />A lot of people get confused with the placement of words like 'too' and 'also' when they speak using such words. Although they mean similar; they are placed very differently in a sentence. Thus, it's imperative to know how they are used and placed in a sentence.<br /><br />Also : is used to add extra information to a sentence.<br />Example : I love jogging. I also love swimming.<br /><br />'Also' comes before a single verb. In the above sentence, it is placed before the single verb 'too'.<br /><br />Example : I am also very late. <br /><br />Please remember, 'also' is placed after the verb 'to be' (is, am, are, was, were).<br /><br />Example : I can also cook well.<br />                I have also visited the new mall.<br /><br />'Also' is placed after a modal / auxiliary verb and before the main verb.<br /><br />Too : Like 'also', 'too' is used to add information to a sentence. It is always placed at the end of the sentence.<br /><br />Example : I am very tired and sleepy too.<br />               She is slim and beautiful too.<br /><br />Too : is used to express something that is in excess. In such cases, 'too' is placed before an adjective.<br /><br />Example : Maria eats too much junk food.<br />                We are too nice to be rude.<br /><br />Too : can be placed after the subject in formal speech.<br /><br />Example : He missed the bus. I, too, missed it.{% endraw %}
