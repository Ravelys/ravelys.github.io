Countless times I down the rabbit hole on one channel, only to later take most of it off. Do you have a technique for limiting yourself on a mix?&quot;<br /><br />Do I have a technique? No, but I just try to move quickly. And I don't mean so quickly that I ignore problems, but I mean move quickly, make decisions quickly, and build something up within an hour or so just so that it is listenable. That way, if I have a decent drum sound, bass sound, guitar, vocals, etc., I can then just start refining or relaxing. For me, the only way to really do this is to move and make decisions quickly.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems I have ever had is exactly what you're talking about, where I've gone in and done WAY too much and spent too much time &quot;overcooking&quot; something, like a drum sound, to where is overpowers every other instrument. <br /><br />Therefore, the best way to avoid this issue is to work quick enough so that you can take a step back and make more &quot;global&quot; decisions when it comes to your mix.<br /><br />❤️My Favorite Plugins:<br />➡️Waves MV2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/mv2%23make-tracks-cut-through-the-mix-with-mv2">https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/mv2%23make-tracks-cut-through-the-mix-with-mv2</a><br />➡️Waves RBass: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/renaissance-bass">https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/renaissance-bass</a><br />➡️Renaissance Vox: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/renaissance-vox">https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/renaissance-vox</a><br />➡️Renaissance Compressor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/renaissance-compressor">https://waves.7eer.net/c/1205870/286864/4512?u=https://www.waves.com/plugins/renaissance-compressor</a><br />➡️Warren Huart IR Pack <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lancasteraudio.com/shop/ir-packs/warren-huart-ir-pack/">https://lancasteraudio.com/shop/ir-packs/warren-huart-ir-pack/</a><br />➡️Warren Huart Kemper Pack <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lancasteraudio.com/shop/kemper-packs/warren-huart-kemper-pack/">https://lancasteraudio.com/shop/kemper-packs/warren-huart-kemper-pack/</a><br /><br />❤️GEAR:<br />➡️Stealth Sonics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stealthsonics.com/?aff=3">https://stealthsonics.com/?aff=3</a><br />➡️UK Sound 1173: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vintageking.com/uk-sound-1173?utm_source=warrenhuart&amp;utm_campaign=uk1173&amp;utm_content=uk1173">https://vintageking.com/uk-sound-1173?utm_source=warrenhuart&amp;utm_campaign=uk1173&amp;utm_content=uk1173</a><br />➡️Apollo x16: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://u.audio/apollox16-plap">https://u.audio/apollox16-plap</a><br />➡️Apollo Twin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://u.audio/apollotwin-plap">https://u.audio/apollotwin-plap</a><br />➡️Check out all of Warren's favourite gear here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imp.i114863.net/ZdxWAz">https://imp.i114863.net/ZdxWAz</a><br />➡️Check out this weeks top deals on Studio Recording Gear here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://imp.i114863.net/6bPZNm">https://imp.i114863.net/6bPZNm</a><br /><br />Join the community here: <br /><br />Facebook Group<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/producelikeapro/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/producelikeapro/</a><br /><br />Facebook Page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/producelikeapro/">https://www.facebook.com/producelikeapro/</a><br /><br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/producelikeapro/">https://www.instagram.com/producelikeapro/</a><br /><br />Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/producelikeapro">https://twitter.com/producelikeapro</a><br /><br />❤️❤️Free 3 Part Mixing Course: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvyoER4Rx0&amp;list=PLnLOmVwRMCqRuyPHQct9DfJ8o4mMNxFTb&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvyoER4Rx0&amp;list=PLnLOmVwRMCqRuyPHQct9DfJ8o4mMNxFTb&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Sign up here to get exclusive videos and content <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://producelikeapro.com">http://producelikeapro.com</a><br /><br />#ProduceLikeAPro<br />#HomeRecording<br />#FAQFriday<br /><br />Giveaway Winners: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.producelikeapro.com/giveaway-winners/">https://www.producelikeapro.com/giveaway-winners/</a><br /><br />Produce Like A Pro is a website which features great tips to help the beginning recordist make incredible sounding home recordings on a budget.{% endraw %}
