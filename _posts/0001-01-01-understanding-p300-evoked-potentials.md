The idea is to smuggle surprising stimuli between boring stimuli. The EEG is only averaged at the moment a surprising stimulus is displayed. This means it's far slower to record than the normal evoked potential. On the plus side it's stronger than the passive one. <br />The timelapse is played ten times faster.<br />Recorded with attys-ep:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/glasgowneuro/attys-ep">https://github.com/glasgowneuro/attys-ep</a>{% endraw %}
