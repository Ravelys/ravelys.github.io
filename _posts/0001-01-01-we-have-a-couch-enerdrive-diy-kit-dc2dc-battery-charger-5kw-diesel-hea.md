{% raw %}On this episode, we finally finish the framing of our couch with our aluminium t-slot profiles.<br /><br />We get started on the wood cutting for the platform and backing of our couch - once again, we recycle the 20mm plywood for the Unimog tray. A lot of sanding involved but the result is worth it - free, high quality &amp; strong wood; it ticks all the boxes!<br />We also get to test some high density foam which we need to get cut to custom dimensions along with the upholstery.<br /><br />We brainstorm our swivel table dimensions with a telescopic/adjustable table - it's almost looking like a complete dining room!<br /><br />We introduce you to the Enerdrive eSYS-e board which includes the ePOWER AC 40Amp and ePOWER DC2DC 40+ Charger. The board is all pre-wired so it's the perfect DIY installation kit.<br /><br />We also progress on the Maxpeedingrods 5KW Diesel heater install with the exhaust pipe, air intake, fuel hose &amp; fuel pump.<br /><br />Final task of the week was the completion of our overhead kitchen cabinet - all made out of aluminium, keeping weight low up high is definitely important!<br /><br /><br />üòé REP our new Sticker - Free Shipping Australia &amp; International<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://payhip.com/theoutfit">https://payhip.com/theoutfit</a><br /><br />üöê SUPPORT our DIY #ExpeditionVehicle build and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE CONTENT on Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/theoutfit">https://www.patreon.com/theoutfit</a><br /><br />üîî SUBSCRIBE to follow our Australia overlanding adventures in our 1983 Ex-Australian Army #Unimog U1700L and for all things outdoors, camping, offroading, hiking, fitness, cooking and spearfishing<br /><br />üìß COLLAB with us <br />theoutfitlife@gmail.com<br /><br />üì∏ FOLLOW US on Instagram :<br /><br />The OutFit @the.out.fit<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the.out.fit">https://www.instagram.com/the.out.fit</a><br /><br />Chris @magnus.outdoors<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/magnus.outdoors">https://www.instagram.com/magnus.outdoors</a><br /><br />Ange @ange.the.baroudeuse<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ange.the.baroudeuse">https://www.instagram.com/ange.the.baroudeuse</a><br /><br />Bowser @bowser.unimog<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bowser.unimog">https://www.instagram.com/bowser.unimog</a><br /><br /><br />Disclaimer : This video and the material covered is for informational purposes only.
