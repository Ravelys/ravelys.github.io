{% raw %}This webinar with Karen Elliott presents an overview of phonics through activities which teachers can use with their students. Key concepts and principles will be introduced through these games and activities. All infants and primary teachers will find something to take away; those who are new to phonics will have an understanding of the process, while teachers who are already using phonics will get activities or ideas which they can immediately, or modify to use with their students.{% endraw %}
