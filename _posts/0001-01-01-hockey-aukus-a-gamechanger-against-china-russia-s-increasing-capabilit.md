{% raw %}Former Ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey has hailed the AUKUS alliance as a “gamechanger,” which represents an “entrée to the crown jewels” of military and intelligence capability. <br /><br />The trilateral agreement will see Australia harness technology from the US and the United Kingdom to manufacture nuclear-powered submarines. <br /><br />Labelling the alliances as “ANZUS 2.0”, Mr Hockey says the announcement is a statement against the increased capabilities of regional power China as well as Russia. <br /><br />“It’s an extraordinary announcement and, in many ways, it’s a gamechanger,” he told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />“It takes us to a new level because it isn’t just about a treaty; importantly, it’s about shared capability and putting real and tangible effort into the sorts of things that will save our nation and protect our nation into the future. <br /><br />“This represents the changing world order, it’s not just about China, even though it is a focus in the Indo-Pacific, but it’s also about Russia, which has significantly increased its capability in recent years.<br /><br />“They’re (the submarines) crown jewels, and this announcement by the United States, the UK and Prime Minister Morrison represents an entrée to the crown jewels of military and intelligence capability.”{% endraw %}
