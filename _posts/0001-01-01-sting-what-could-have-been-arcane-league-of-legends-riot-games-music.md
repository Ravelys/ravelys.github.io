{% raw %}Here's to the new us. Listen to Sting's &quot;What Could Have Been&quot; ft. Ray Chen off the Arcane Original Soundtrack.<br /><br />Riot Games presents Arcane, a new animated streaming television series on Netflix from the world of League of Legends. In the cities of Piltover and Zaun, unrest stirs as inventors and thieves, politicians and crime lords chafe against the constraints of a society torn asunder. As dissent reaches a fever pitch, two sisters steal an artifact of untold power. Discovery and danger intertwine as heroes are born and bonds are broken. Will this power change the world, or lead it to ruin? This is the world of Arcane. Champions Jinx and Vi struggle to overcome their shared past in a new era of magic and technology.<br /><br />PRODUCTION CREDITS<br />What Could Have Been<br />Featured artist: Sting &amp; Ray Chen<br />Written by: Alex Seaver of Mako<br />Produced by: Alex Seaver of Mako &amp; Sebastien Najand<br />Vocals by: Sting<br />Mixed by: Robert Orton<br />Mastered by: Mike Bozzi (Bernie Grundman Mastering)<br /><br />Sting appears courtesy of A&amp;M Records<br />Ray Chen appears courtesy of Decca Records<br /><br />LISTEN NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen">https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen</a>        <br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-spotify">https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-spotify</a><br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-applemusic">https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-applemusic</a><br />Amazon Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-amazonmusic">https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-amazonmusic</a><br />Youtube Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-youtube">https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-youtube</a><br />Deezer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-deezer">https://found.ee/whatcouldhavebeen-deezer</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theofficialsting">https://www.instagram.com/theofficialsting</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/raychenviolin">https://www.instagram.com/raychenviolin</a><br /><br />LYRICS<br />I am the monster you created<br />You ripped out all my parts<br />And worst of all, for me to live, I gotta kill the part of me that saw<br />That I needed you more<br /><br />I hope you know we had everything<br />When you broke me and left these pieces<br />I want you to hurt like you hurt me today and<br />I want you to lose like I lose when I play What Could Have Been<br />Oh, What Could Have Been<br /><br />Why don’t you love who I am?
