{% raw %}DT Swiss makes some of the best hubs in the mountain bike world, plain and simple. So when they reached out for us to custom build a UNNO Dash spec'd with their brand new oil slick 240 EXP hubs, EX511 rims, and F535 fork, we knew a dream build video was needed. Starting with the #1 out of 50 UNNO Dash frame built-in 2021, the guys and girls at DT Swiss spared no expense when picking parts for this bike. That includes a SRAM Eagle AXS drivetrain, RockShox Reverb AXS dropper post, EXT Racing coil shock, OneUp handlebars, oil slick bolts, oil slick Ergon grips, and much, much, more!
