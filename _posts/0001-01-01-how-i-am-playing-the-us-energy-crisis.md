{% raw %}How I am playing the US energy crisis. While the US plays the aggressor, CAPEX will remain light with uncertainty surrounding the future of their industry under the current US administration. <br /><br />I have decided that a good way to play this is by investing in Transocean, RIG lease deep sea rigs and with more uncertainty in tandem with high oil prices CAPEX will likely be pushed into international waters. <br /><br />The utilization rate is expected to hit 80% in Q1 with an ages/shrinking available rig count. This set the stage for significantly higher day rates over the coming years. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />📈 𝘾𝙝𝙚𝙘𝙠 𝙤𝙪𝙩 &quot;𝙏𝙝𝙚 𝙋𝙤𝙥𝙪𝙡𝙖𝙧 𝙄𝙣𝙫𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙧&quot; 𝙥𝙪𝙗𝙡𝙞𝙘𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙤 𝙞𝙢𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙫𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝙖𝙨𝙨𝙚𝙩 𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙤𝙘𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 &amp; 𝙗𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙞𝙨𝙠𝙨: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Zs7Oja">http://bit.ly/2Zs7Oja</a><br /><br />🚀 𝙏𝙤 𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬 𝙢𝙮 𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙛𝙤𝙡𝙞𝙤 (𝙍𝙤𝙗𝙚𝙧𝙩𝙈𝙀𝙍𝘾): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XOPSii">https://bit.ly/2XOPSii</a><br /><br />🔬 𝙒𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙄 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙘𝙝 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙘𝙠𝙨 (𝙏𝙄𝙆𝙍 𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.tikr.com/register?ref=keylul">https://app.tikr.com/register?ref=keylul</a><br /><br />📈 𝙅𝙤𝙞𝙣 𝙚𝙏𝙤𝙧𝙤 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙨𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚 𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2DLLXw6">https://bit.ly/2DLLXw6</a><br /><br />eToro is a multi-asset platform that offers both investing in stocks and crypto assets, as well as trading CFDs.
