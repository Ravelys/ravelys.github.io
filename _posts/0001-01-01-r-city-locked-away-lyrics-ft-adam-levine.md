City Lyrics<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />If I got locked away<br />And we lost it all today<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br />If I showed you my flaws<br />If I couldn't be strong<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br /><br />[Verse 1: R. City]<br />Right about now<br />If a judge 'for life' me, would ya stay by my side?<br />Or is you gonna say goodbye?<br />Can you tell me right now?<br />If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life<br />Shawty, would it be alright?<br />Come on, show me that you are down<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: R. City]<br />Now tell me, would you really ride for me?<br />(Would you really ride for me?)<br />Baby, tell me, would you die for me?<br />(Tell me, would you die for me?)<br />Would you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)<br />Would you be there to always hold me down?<br />Tell me, would you really cry for me?<br />(Would you really cry for me?)<br />Baby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)<br />If I didn't have anything (Wassup)<br />I wanna know, would you stick around?<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />If I got locked away<br />And we lost it all today<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br />If I showed you my flaws<br />If I couldn't be strong<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br /><br />[Verse 2: R. City]<br />Skiddly dong, dong, dong, dang<br />All I want is somebody real, who don't need much<br />A gyal I know that I can trust<br />To be here when money low<br />If I did not have nothing else to give but love<br />Would that even be enough? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)<br />Gyal me need fi know, aha<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: R. City]<br />Now tell me, would you really ride for me?<br />(Would you really ride for me?)<br />Baby, tell me, would you die for me?<br />(Tell me, would you die for me?)<br />Would you spend your whole life with me? (Wassup)<br />Would you be there to always hold me down?<br />Tell me, would you really cry for me?<br />(Would you really cry for me?)<br />Baby, don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie to me)<br />If I didn't have anything (Wassup)<br />I wanna know, would you stick around?<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />If I got locked away<br />And we lost it all today<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br />If I showed you my flaws<br />If I couldn't be strong<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br /><br />[Bridge: R. City]<br />Tell me, tell me, would you want me? (Want me)<br />Tell me, tell me, would you call me? (Call me)<br />If you knew I wasn't balling<br />'Cause I need a gyal who's always by my side<br />Tell me, tell me, do you need me? (Need me)<br />Tell me, tell me, do you love me? (Yeah)<br />Or is you just tryna play me?<br />'Cause I need a gyal to hold me down for life<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />If I got locked away<br />And we lost it all today<br />Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?<br />If I showed you my flaws<br />If I couldn't be strong<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br />If I got locked away<br />And we lost it all today<br />Tell me honestly would you still love me the same?<br />If I showed you my flaws<br />If I couldn't be strong<br />Tell me honestly, would you still love me the same?<br /><br />[Outro: Adam Levine]<br />Would you still love me the same?{% endraw %}
