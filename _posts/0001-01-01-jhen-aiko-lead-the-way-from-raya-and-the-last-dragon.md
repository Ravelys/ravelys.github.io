But when an evil force threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity. Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and its divided people. However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well.<br /><br />“Raya and the Last Dragon” features an outstanding voice cast, including Kelly Marie Tran as the voice of the intrepid warrior Raya; Awkwafina as the legendary dragon, Sisu; Gemma Chan as Raya’s nemesis, Namaari; Daniel Dae Kim as Raya’s visionary father, Benja; Sandra Oh as Namaari’s powerful mother, Virana; Benedict Wong as Tong, a formidable giant; Izaac Wang as Boun, a 10-year-old entrepreneur; Thalia Tran as the mischievous toddler Little Noi; Alan Tudyk as Tuk Tuk, Raya’s best friend and trusty steed; Lucille Soong as Dang Hu, the leader of the land of Talon; Patti Harrison as the chief of the Tail land; and Ross Butler as chief of the Spine land.<br /><br />Follow Disney Music:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/disneymusic">https://facebook.com/disneymusic</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/disneymusic">https://twitter.com/disneymusic</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/disneymusic">https://instagram.com/disneymusic</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic">https://www.tiktok.com/@disneymusic</a><br /><br />#DisneyRaya #JhenéAiko #LeadTheWay<br /><br />Music video by Jhené Aiko performing Lead the Way (From &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;/Official Video). © 2021 Walt Disney Records<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/umFSpm">http://vevo.ly/umFSpm</a>{% endraw %}
