{% raw %}In this animated lecture, I will teach you the concept of mixture, different types of mixture, homogeneous mixture, heterogeneous mixture, difference between homogeneous mixture and heterogeneous mixture and exampl of homogeneous and heterogeneous mixture.<br /><br />Q: What is mixture?<br />Ans: Mixture is defined as when two or more substances combine together physically in any ratio by mass is known as mixture.<br />Mixture is just physically combination of different substances.<br />For example, when water plus table salt is mixed together, we get a mixture.<br />When sugar plus water is mixed together we get a mixture. Also, when you mix vegetables to make salad, you get a mixture.<br /><br />Q: What is homogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Examples of homogeneous mixture?<br />Ans: A mixture which has uniform composition throughout its mass is know as homogeneous mixture. <br />For example, when you put some sugars into the water, it dissolves in the water and make a uniform mixture or uniform solution. This uniform mixture is called homogeneous mixture.<br />Similarly, when you mix water and table salt, you get homogeneous mixture.<br /><br />Q: What is heterogeneous mixture?<br />Q: Examples of heterogeneous mixture?<br />Ans: A mixture which has non uniform composition throughout its mass is known as heterogeneous mixture.<br />For example, when you put small pebbles into the water, the pebbles and water can be seen and it doesn't make a uniform mixture or uniform solution. Thus, we call it as heterogeneous mixture.<br />Similarly, when you put oil into the water, you get heterogeneous mixture.<br /><br />After watching this video, you will also learn the difference between homogeneous mixture and heterogeneous mixture.<br /><br /><br />#HomogeneousMixture<br />#HeterogeneousMixture<br />#HomogeneousVsHeterogeneousMixture<br />#TypesOfMixture<br />#ClassificationOfMatter<br />#Chemistry<br /><br />Subscribe my channel at:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Youtube link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ltCdLVMRZ7r3IPzF2Toyg</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Najamacademy/">https://www.facebook.com/Najamacademy/</a>{% endraw %}
