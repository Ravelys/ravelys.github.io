A soft bed or sofa won’t work – it's better to use a fitness mat on the floor. Put the rolled towel behind you.<br />- Gently lie down on your back holding the towel so that it is across your body directly under your waist. Exactly under your navel!<br />- Spread your legs shoulder-width apart and bring the feet together making them look in-toed.  Your big toes should be pointed toward one another. Your heels should be 8 to 10 inches apart (20-25 cm).<br />- Straighten your arms by the head, turn them palms down, and connect your pinkies.<br />- Now all you need to do is hold this position for 5 minutes.<br />- After that, stand up gently not to hurt yourself as your bones and joints slightly move during the exercise.<br />- Your hands, legs, and the towel should be in the correct positions.<br />- It's difficult to hold this position for 5 minutes in the beginning, so you can perform the exercise for 2 to 3 minutes. You will notice the results in a month!<br />- This technique is a great alternative to posture correction practices. Also, you will significantly shrink your waist and get the perfect belly.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: welcome@brightside.me<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC ">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC </a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
