Post in comments section of this video!<br /><br />About This Video:<br /><br />In this video, Rob talks about an important insight learned through doing hundreds of clothing brand reviews - that the most common issue most startup clothing brands have is a fluffy brand concept. Most new clothing lines overlook the importance of clear brand messaging that is easy to understand and conceptualize. For anyone starting a clothing brand, it is vital to place a high priority on nailing your clothing brand concept so that your marketing efforts pay off. Attempting to market your clothing brand on a weak foundation will only frustrate you with no sales/orders through your website. The secret to selling a lot of clothing is to master your brand concept FIRST - and implement a solid marketing plan on top of it. This information applies to clothing brands, clothing lines, fashion brands, fashion lines, tshirt companies, streetwear brands, streetwear lines, print on demand (POD), dropshipping and beyond!{% endraw %}
