This method may take a lot of bay leaves and patience, but it’s a nice natural way to send roaches packing. <br />-You can use garlic- or onion powder, and sprinkle it in and around their favorite hangout spots.<br />-The lemon juice will effectively repel these pests, and your kitchen will smell amazing too!<br />-Just fill a medium-sized spray bottle with mostly vinegar, and add enough drops of peppermint essential oil so that you can smell it. Spray your kitchen and bathroom. <br />-Neem oil keeps away a lot of insects and pests because it contains a certain chemical that’s poisonous to them.<br />-Cockroaches and similar pests breathe through the pores of their shells and skin, so when they start crawling around in this soap, the borax will get the job done. <br />-Put some fresh catnip leaves in a sachet – you know, those little sheer drawstring bags usually used for steeping tea – or other porous bag. Cockroaches can’t stand it. <br />-Once you’ve put the traps together, place them in the spots where you think the roaches are coming from, like nice dark places for them to look for food and water. <br />-The sweet sugary smell attracts roaches, so they eat the powder mixture. Once they take a drink of water, it reacts with the baking soda, and, well, let’s just say the roaches get a bad case of bubble guts.<br />-Cut a sizable strip of duct tape off the roll, maybe about the length of your forearm. Put the strip sticky-side-up, and fold down each end so that it’s easy to pick up and dispose of later on. You’ll also need a bait.<br />-The cockroaches will climb in to go after the bait, but they won’t be able to climb back up the slippery surface to escape.<br />-Roaches are drawn to the smell of coffee too, so they’ll climb in after the grounds but won’t be able to get out since they’re not the greatest of swimmers.<br />-If you try any of these natural remedies over time but it doesn’t seem to make a difference, then it’s probably high-time to call a professional!<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
