{% raw %}&quot;That's The Power&quot; by Hillsong Worship, recorded live and led by Benjamin Hastings. <br /><br />&quot;That’s The Power” is a joy-filled, emphatic song that celebrates the matchless power of the Name of Jesus. In times of uncertainty, we can rest assured that He’s the same God now as He’s always been. The mighty Name of Jesus stirs up courage, brings restoration and heals the mind, body and spirit. A strong and emboldening anthem for the church today, “That’s The Power” encourages us to remember that God keeps His promises and that victory in the Name of Jesus is the portion of those who trust Him.<br /><br />Listen to That's The Power: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worship.lnk.to/thesesameskiesID">https://worship.lnk.to/thesesameskiesID</a><br />Watch to the latest from Hillsong Worship here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hillsong.lnk.to/ytplaylist">https://hillsong.lnk.to/ytplaylist</a><br />Click to subscribe to our channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worship.lnk.to/subscribe">https://worship.lnk.to/subscribe</a><br /><br />Stay connected<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/hillsongworship">https://instagram.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/hillsongworship">https://facebook.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hillsongworship">https://twitter.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hillsong.com/worship">https://hillsong.com/worship</a><br /><br />That's The Power<br />Words and Music by<br />Michael Fatkin, Benjamin Hastings &amp; Alexander Pappas<br />© 2021 Hillsong Music Publishing Australia<br />CCLI: 7177422<br /><br />VERSE 1: <br />There’s a Name that levels mountains<br />Carves out highways through the sea<br />I’ve seen its power unravel battles<br />Right in front of me<br /><br />There’s a faith that stands defiant<br />Sends Goliath to his knees<br />I’ve seen as praise unravelled shackles<br />Right off my feet<br /><br />CHORUS:<br />That’s the power of Your Name<br />Just a mention makes a way<br />Giants fall and strongholds break<br />And there is healing<br /><br />That’s the power that I claim<br />It’s the same that rolled the grave<br />There’s no power like the <br />Mighty Name of Jesus<br /><br />VERSE 2:<br />There’s a hope that calls out courage<br />In the furnace unafraid<br />The kind of daring expectation<br />That every prayer I make <br />Is on an empty grave<br /><br />BRIDGE:<br />I see You taking ground<br />I see You press ahead<br />Your power is dangerous to <br />The enemy’s camp<br /><br />You still do miracles<br />You will do what You said<br />For You’re the same God now as <br />You’ve always been<br /><br />Your Spirit breaking out<br />Your kingdom moving in<br />Your victory claims the ground that <br />The enemy had<br /><br />You still do miracles<br />You will do what You said<br />For You’re the same God now as <br />You’ve always been<br /><br />#thatsthepower #thesesameskies #hillsongworship{% endraw %}
