You don’t need to imagine because researchers are always on the lookout for, especially creepy animals. If you thought they would stop after discovering a ghostly shrimp-like creature with 12 retinas, you were wrong! There is also a weirdly gelatinous fish living in the muddy waters that will freak you out. But what awaits you at number one is going to make your skin crawl! Here are 12 Creepy Animals Recently Discovered that will haunt your dreams!<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br />Watch our “15 Scary Animals But Not Dangerous”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GiBVyMpYAoI">https://youtu.be/GiBVyMpYAoI</a><br />Watch our “10 Terrifying Animals That Are Actually Friendly”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Cqv4X1CtxZ0">https://youtu.be/Cqv4X1CtxZ0</a><br />Watch our “12 Scariest Animal Encounters Caught On Camera”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SGs_5mvx1Uk">https://youtu.be/SGs_5mvx1Uk</a><br /><br />Pelican Spiders<br /><br />The Pelican spiders have had a long journey in terms of discovery. Their fossils were first found in the 1840s in amber and not one living specimen was found until recently. These spiders lack one crucial talent that every other spider has - the ability to spin webs! Instead, these creatures eat other spiders. <br /><br />They're barely even 2 to 8 millimeters big yet they'll happily chomp on other spiders bravely. They have unusual &quot;neck&quot; structures that go from slender and long to fat. Moreover, their name comes from their elongated jaws and necks that they use to snap and eat other spiders. Well, at least this one won't bite you!<br /><br />Blue Atacama Fish<br /><br />When you think of a fish, you picture something bright and colorful. Not something as boring as the newly discovered Blue Atacama Fish. These fish look more like short ghostly tadpoles than anything else. And because they live in the deepest corners of the ocean, they barely have anything solid in their bodies. <br /><br />The pressure of the water is enough to keep their bodies intact so they don't need too many bones. These gooey fish need the crushing weight of the ocean on top of them because when they're brought to the surface, they literally just melt! If you've seen the Blobfish out of the water, then you can imagine what these ghost fish look like! <br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
