If you are using this song at home or in the classroom with young children, blow some imaginary bubbles and “pop” them as you sing along. Afterwards, blow some real bubbles and have fun popping and counting! 🎶 Are you ready to pop some bubbles? First we have to make them. Ready? One, two, three, blow! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10<br />Stop!
