{% raw %}The third dimension is where most people (bots) are at. Dimensions are levels of consciousness in which we perceive reality. So people in the third dimension will live life the same as 99.9% of the rest of the world in terms of their values, their beliefs, their ideology on life, who and what they look up to, etc. When you have a Spiritual Awakening, it is most likely that you're ascending to the fourth dimension of consciousness, and you begin to have a shift in perspective on life as well as your outlook on yourself. You begin to be alot more self aware and question things about life you normally would've never second guessed.<br />Alot of people will forever stay in the third dimension while others raise their vibration to a high enough frequency to ascend to the fourth and fifth dimensions. Raising your vibration usually comes with meditation, eating healthy, practicing mindfulness, gaining profound knowledge and understanding of the world, getting Sun light, being in nature, taking care of your mind, body, and soul. It's the only way to escape this Matrix<br />Hope you guys are doing well, Make sure you stay true, and I'll talk to you real soon, <br />- Jackey<br /><br />What is the Third Dimension?
