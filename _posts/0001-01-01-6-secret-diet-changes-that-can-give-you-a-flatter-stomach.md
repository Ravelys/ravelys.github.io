Vitamin B to Get Rid Of Stomach Fat<br />If you didnâ€™t know, psychological stress can cause belly fat to form. When you're under a lot of stress, your body creates more cortisol, also known as the stress hormone. While cortisol is beneficial during moments of fight or flight, excessive production can cause cortisol spikes. Some research suggests it may cause fat deposits in the abdomen.<br /><br />2. Eat Slowly To Cut Down On Your Belly Fat <br />If you eat too quickly and forget to control your portions, your belly is going to get bigger. Eating slowly can reduce the amount of food ingested throughout a meal. This is thanks to an increase in satiety hormones.<br /><br />3. Intermittent Fasting<br />This is one youâ€™ve definitely heard about. If you have a friend whoâ€™s a workout junkie, theyâ€™ve certainly brought up intermittent fasting once or twice. Well have you ever considered the idea that theyâ€™re on to something? <br /><br />4. Eat Lunch Out Instead Of Dinner<br />How many of you eat at restaurants? Depending on our social life, many of us may eat out several times a week. Even some of our jobs require meeting with coworkers and wolfing down greasy fried foods. This catches up in the long run. <br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a>{% endraw %}
