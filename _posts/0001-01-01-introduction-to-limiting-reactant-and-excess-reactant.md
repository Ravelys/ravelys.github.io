{% raw %}Limiting reactant is also called limiting reagent. The limiting reactant or limiting reagent is the first reactant to get used up in a chemical reaction. Once the limiting reactant or limiting reagent gets used up, the reaction has to stop and cannot continue. After the limiting reactant or limiting reagent is used up and the reaction stops, there is extra of the other reactants left over. Those are called the excess reactants. In this video, we'll first learn about limiting reactant and limiting reagent by comparing chemical reactions to cooking recipes. We'll look at how to calculate limiting reactant and limiting reagent using cooking ingredients, and then looking at an actual stoichiometry problem,{% endraw %}
