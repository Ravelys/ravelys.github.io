{% raw %}Most of us get the creeps by seeing any kind of reptile, even if it’s super tiny! They just have that way of looking at you that makes it feel like they’ll just come and eat you alive! But that feeling gets amplified the bigger the reptile is! From a giant snapping turtle, a massive crocodile, to a king cobra that should not have been that big; here are 12 of the largest reptiles ever captured by humans.<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “20 Times Animals Showed Human Intelligence”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/w1moibFqfOM">https://youtu.be/w1moibFqfOM</a><br />Watch our “15 Animals That Are One Of A Kind”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EAdOqzqMvHY">https://youtu.be/EAdOqzqMvHY</a><br />Watch our “12 Animals That Can Live After Death”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OlWUhL2cdy8">https://youtu.be/OlWUhL2cdy8</a><br /><br />Highway Diamondback Rattlesnake <br /><br />They say if you’re looking for scary reptiles and animals, you’ll probably find it all in Florida, you just will, even if you’re not actually looking for them! That’s exactly what happened to a couple in Bartow in 2017. They went out birdwatching, something they had done several times before, but while they were going about their day, they saw something massive coming towards them, and they could not believe their eyes. <br /><br />It was a rattlesnake, the biggest diamondback rattlesnake they had ever seen! It was a whopping 9 feet long and it was so wide that they thought that it had eaten an entire horse! Even if it hadn’t, if they didn’t get away from it fast enough, it could’ve easily grabbed one of them, or worse! But thankfully, they were able to get back to their car before that could happen! <br /><br />Giant Alligator Snapping Turtle <br /><br />Even though it doesn’t seem like Alligator snapping turtles can even exist in real life, they very much do, and despite the fact that their numbers are dwindling by the day, there are still some wild ones that are found in the rivers! These turtles are freshwater turtles, and researcher and rescuer, Luke Pearson had been searching for these turtles for years! <br /><br />He’d capture them and send them to safer environments and although he had caught several of them over the years, nothing prepared him for the catch he had in July of 2020! It was a 150-pound specimen, so big that its head alone was the size of a basketball! And his legs were bigger than Luke’s own calves! Making it one of the biggest, most shocking Alligator snapping turtles ever captured! <br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
