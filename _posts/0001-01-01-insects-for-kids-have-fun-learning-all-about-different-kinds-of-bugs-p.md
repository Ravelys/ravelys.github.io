{% raw %}Insects for kids is a fun video where we get to learn all about bugs!  We start by identifying different kinds of bugs like butterflies, beetles, moths, arachnids, etc.  We then take a deeper look at what makes up the bodies of insects: the head, thorax, abdomen. By the end of the video your students or kids will be able to better distinguish and identify the differences between types of bugs and identify important characteristics of each kind. They should also be able to name a few different kind of bugs as well! <br /><br />If you like this video we also invite you to check out our free lesson plan on bugs, that is complete with more worksheets, activities, content pages and other fun teaching ideas.
