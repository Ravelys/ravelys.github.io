{% raw %}The word legend gets thrown around quite a lot, but in the case of Daniel Lebron it is as accurate as it gets. Join our day with Dani as we get a quick session at Paral-lel in before the sun forces us inside (where we explore his guitar finesse), head to the beach to grab some food, and wrap the day up with more skating. Dani is one of those skaters you can never watch enough footage of. When these people back their skating with a great personality they become favorite skateboarders. You are looking at one. Enjoy. <br /><br />Filmed by Dennis Ludwig<br />Edited by Bennet Rahm<br />Photos by Gerard Riera <br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Paral-lel Warm Up<br />5:50 Flamenco Session<br />7:00 Stories &amp; Room Tour<br />11:09 Beach<br />12:08 Afternoon Skate Session<br />14:12 Last Spot of the Day<br />16:47 More Stories &amp; End of the Day<br /><br /><br />Get our books &amp; apparel collection here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/">https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/</a><br /><br />Feel free to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag">http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pocketskatemag.com">http://www.pocketskatemag.com</a>{% endraw %}
