{% raw %}~Lyrics~<br /><br />Why don't you wait here while I borrow<br />Something you say, dear, you should follow<br />If pain just stays 'til tomorrow<br />Then that's okay<br />Hey, it's only sorrow<br /><br />'Cause it's you who takes care of everyone else<br />You need to allow me to help<br />You are appreciated<br />'Cause it's you who somehow is always the first<br />To take care of me at my worst<br />You are appreciated<br /><br />It's just today<br />Hey, there's tomorrow<br />All things will change<br />Hey, that's the motto<br />When you're down, be down<br />When you're out, be out<br />I will pull you up 'cause without a doubt<br />If tables turned around<br />You'd pick me off the ground<br /><br />'Cause it's you who takes care of everyone else<br />You need to allow me to help<br />You are appreciated<br />'Cause it's you who somehow is always the first<br />To take care of me at my worst<br />You are appreciated<br /><br />'Cause it's you who takes care of everyone else<br />You need to allow me to help<br />You are appreciated<br />'Cause it's you who takes care of everyone else<br />You need to allow me to help<br />You are appreciated<br />'Cause it's you who somehow is always the first<br />To take care of me at my worst<br />You are appreciated{% endraw %}
