Megan Thee Stallion<br /><br />[Verse 1: Adam Levine]<br />It's beautiful, it's bittersweet<br />You're like a broken home to me<br />I take a shot of memories<br />And black out like an empty street<br />I fill my days with the way you walk<br />And fill my nights with broken dreams<br />I make up lies inside my head<br />Like one day you'll come back to me<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Now I'm not holding on, not holding on<br />I'm just depressed that you're gone<br />Not holding on, not holding on<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Beautiful mistakes<br />I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed<br />And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes<br />I wouldn't take '–µm back, I'm in love with the past<br />And now we li–µ awake, makin' beautiful mistakes<br /><br />[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Nah-nah-nah, in my head<br />Nah-nah-nah, in my bed<br />Nah-nah-nah, eh<br />Makin' beautiful mistakes<br /><br />[Verse 2: Adam Levine]<br />It's pitiful, I can't believe<br />How every day gets worse for me<br />I take a break, I cut you off<br />To keep myself from lookin' soft<br />I fill my nights with the way you was<br />And still wake up with broken dreams<br />I make these lies inside my head<br />Feel like they're my reality<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Now I'm not holding on, not holding on<br />I'm just depressed that you're gone<br />Not holding on, not holding on<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Beautiful mistakes<br />I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed<br />And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes<br />I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past<br />And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes<br /><br />[Verse 3: Megan Thee Stallion]<br />You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)<br />Usually, I like my situations beneficial<br />Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)<br />The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)<br />Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)<br />Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)<br />But really, I was doin' just fine without ya<br />Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)<br />Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)<br />Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)<br />How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)<br />You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)<br /><br />[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]<br />Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)<br />Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)<br />Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)<br />Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)<br />I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)<br />Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)<br />And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)<br />You're toxic<br /><br />[Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Beautiful mistakes<br />I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed<br />And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes<br />I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past<br />And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes<br /><br />[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]<br />Nah-nah-nah, in my head<br />Nah-nah-nah, in my bed<br />Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (Oh)<br />Makin' beautiful mistakes<br />Nah-nah-nah, in my head<br />Nah-nah-nah, in my bed<br />Nah-nah-nah, eh<br />Makin' beautiful mistakes<br /><br />[Outro: Adam Levine]<br />Nah-nah-nah<br />Nah-nah-nah (Ooh)<br />Nah-nah-nah<br /><br />.........<br />üì∑ Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />üìß Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org<br />.........<br />üíå Demos / Music Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com">https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com</a><br />.........<br /><br />#Maroon5  #BeautifulMistakes #Lyrics #MeganTheeStallion{% endraw %}
