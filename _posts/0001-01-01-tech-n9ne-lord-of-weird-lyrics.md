{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />When I first started out<br />Thought to myself, &quot;Spread your heart about&quot;<br />Never thought that people look at my art and doubt<br />Wanna bar this mouth, then they darted out<br />Then the same energy let it charted out (Chuh)<br />King James, that show you things changed<br />To the Queen Weymon with King Waynes from Ving Rhames<br />The scene came from extreme brains to teen lames<br />Get your green, mane, while I fling Strange in a bling lane (Chuh)<br />So I go dye my hair rojo<br />Way back in '99, homies who saw me call me homo<br />But then the rumors started that I worship Jesus logo<br />Flippin’ it upside down but no-no, so many fear this wicked bozo<br />But now it's accepted like they finally infected<br />With the formidable Tech shit, like it's normal to go mesh with<br />The darkness (Chuh)<br />I was on a mission, black sphere<br />20 years ago, but now they love it<br />Isn’t that weird?<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Oh, Lord<br />This thing is<br />So (Weird, weird) yours<br />So bring it<br />Home, Lord<br />This thing is<br />So (Weird, weird) yours (Weird, weird)<br />So bring it<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I'm the nigga that started this<br />But I didn't switch my hips like a bitch and dress like Spartacus<br />My art is sick, bombarded with retarded quick<br />Nice flows for the psychos<br />They don't like those with the tight clothes<br />What they want is Tecca N9na when the light goes<br />Way low, the K.O.D. shit<br />Fatally spray on these hits<br />Place go like Dave-o, Waco<br />When I ain't flow, he pray on these tricks<br />I'm the nigga with the spiked hair<br />Painted face with the robe, night scare<br />Many people think 'cause I was quite rare<br />But tonight, there for the nightmare<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Oh, this is not, lost what I seek (Spirits, spirits, spirits)<br />Oh, this cigar up my sleeve (Spirits, spirits, spirits)<br />I am here to muzzle who<br />Those who think their hustle new<br />They're not any trouble to the L.O.W.<br />I am here to muzzle who<br />Those who think their hustle new<br />They’re not any trouble to the L.O.W.<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Oh, Lord<br />This thing is<br />So (Weird, weird) yours<br />So bring it<br />Home, Lord<br />This thing is<br />So (Weird, weird) yours (Weird, weird)<br />So bring it{% endraw %}
