I really appreciate it!<br /><br />*** English Lesson Notes / transcript:  ***<br /><br />And today I will teach you some phrasal verbs with the word hit including ‘hit up’ and ‘hit on’.  <br /><br />But first let’s review definitions for the word ‘hit’ by itself.  <br /><br />1) Hit - to strike something.<br />2) to affect something in a bad or damaging way<br />The farms were hit hard by the drought.<br />3) to suddenly understand something <br />I didn’t understand what she was talking about, then it suddenly hit me. <br />4)  to get or reach a level or goal<br />I’m really hoping I will hit 1000 youtube subscribers soon!<br />5) to turn (something) on or off with a switch <br />Could someone please hit the lights?  He hit the brakes pretty hard.  <br />-------------------<br />[Fun Fact:]<br />I’m not doing idioms with the word hit in this lesson but you might be interested in listening to a song by<br />Pat Benatar called: Hit me with your best shot<br />The phrase ‘hit me with your best shot’, when used literally means to hit someone as hard as you can.  Used figuratively, it means more to dare someone to hurt you or challenge you in some way because you feel stronger and tougher and aren’t afraid of what they might do to you.  <br />A link to the video is here , you can wait and watch when this lesson is done, just click the little white i later.  Or also, there’s a link in the description below my video.  <br />-------------------<br />[hit as a noun]<br />Noun – here’s two common uses of it as a noun:<br />1 used to describe being hit, usually used with the word ‘take’, as in:<br />Now, if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth.  But you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers.  <br />- that’s from the movie Rocky Balboa and if you want to listen to it – click up here as soon as my video is done.  Or click on the link in the description.<br />(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uyTAfX7cniI?t=44s)">https://youtu.be/uyTAfX7cniI?t=44s)</a><br />2  something that is very successful <br />That song was a big hit for Pat Benatar.<br /><br />[phrasal verbs]<br />Hit on (someone)<br />To talk or flirt with someone because you are attracted to them.  <br />Every time she goes to conferences there are many men hitting on her. <br /><br />Hit it off<br />To get along with or have a good relationship with someone soon after you meet them.<br />They met last month and really hit if off right away and are now engaged to be married.<br /><br />Hit back<br />- literal<br />to respond strongly in response to criticism<br />They said his company wouldn’t meet its goals for the year but he hit back by tweeting: ‘Place your bets …’.  <br /><br />hit upon something <br />to suddenly have an idea – related to definition 3 earlier.<br />He’s been working really hard on that problem and I think he may have finally hit upon a solution. <br /><br />Hit (someone) up<br />Ask someone for some money<br />He’s always hitting my up for more money.  <br />----------------<br />[Boring grammar]<br />I’m sorry, but I should review a little grammar here, even though it is really, boring.  But don’t worry, it won’t take too long!<br />Hit (someone) up is an example of a separable phrasal verb.   If a phrasal verb is separable, it means you can separate the two words and put a direct object in the middle.<br />Hit on (someone) is an example of a transitive phrasal verb.  It needs a direct object after ‘hit on’.<br />Using the sentence earlier: Every time she goes to conferences there are many men hitting on her.  You can’t say: Every time she goes to conferences there are many men hitting on.  You need to include a direct object at the end or it sounds incomplete. <br />-----------------<br />[Practice Exercises]<br />Fill in the blanks with one of the phrasal verbs used in this lesson.  <br />1) I’m hoping that if I ever meet him, we’ll really ___ __ ___.<br />2) At first I thought he was just talking to me to be nice, but now I think he was trying to ___ __ __.<br />3) If I keep working hard, maybe someday I will __ ____ a way to get a lot of youtube subscribers. <br /><br />--------------------<br />[More ways to learn!]<br />Want to learn more phrasal verbs?
