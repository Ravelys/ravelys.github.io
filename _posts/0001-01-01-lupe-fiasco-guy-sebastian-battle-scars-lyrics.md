With no Tom Hanks to bring you home<br />A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem<br />Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song<br />To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian]<br />I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched<br />I wish that I could stop loving you so much<br />'Cause I’m the only one that's tryna keep us together<br />When all of the signs say that I should forget her<br />I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had<br />I wish that the good outweighed the bad<br />'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over<br /><br />[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />They ain't never gonna change<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />They ain't never gonna change<br />These battle<br /><br />[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]<br />(And just leave then)<br />You shouldn't have but you said it<br />(And I hope you never come back)<br />It shouldn't have happened but you let it<br />Now you're down on the ground screaming &quot;medic&quot;<br />The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses<br />Shields, body armors and vests<br />Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt<br />The enemy within and all the fires from your friends<br />The best medicine is to probably just let her win<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus 2: Guy Sebastian]<br />I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love<br />I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much<br />'Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together<br />When all of the signs say that I should forget her<br />I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had<br />I wish that the good outweighed the bad<br />'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over<br /><br />[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />They ain't never gonna change<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />They ain't never gonna change<br />These battle<br /><br />[Bridge: Guy Sebastian &amp; Lupe Fiasco]<br />'Cause you've set me on fire<br />I’ve never felt so alive, yeah<br />No, hoping wounds heal, but it never does<br />That's because you're at war with love<br />And I’m at the point of breaking<br />And it’s impossible to shake it<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]<br />See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does<br />That's cause you're at war with love<br />Hope it heals, but it never does<br />That's cause you're at war with love!<br /><br />[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />I ain't ever gonna change<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />They ain't never gonna change<br />These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading<br />Don’t look like they’re ever going away<br />I ain't ever gonna change<br />These battle<br /><br />Connect with us :<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2SSyXJt">https://bit.ly/2SSyXJt</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/2A0BUks">https://spoti.fi/2A0BUks</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fk21Ty">https://bit.ly/3fk21Ty</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ytd6RF">https://bit.ly/2ytd6RF</a><br />Let's Be Friends on Facebook // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YyGFvF">https://bit.ly/2YyGFvF</a><br /><br /><br />&quot;If you'd like to submit a video to the channel, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unitedframes.tv/superb">https://www.unitedframes.tv/superb</a><br />Or contact samuel@unitedframes.tv&quot;<br /><br />Lupe Fiasco, Guy Sebastian - Battle Scars (Lyrics)<br /><br />#BattleScars #LupeFiasco #GuySebastian{% endraw %}
