{% raw %}Prostate cancer which has spread outside of the prostate gland is treated with systemic therapy. However, these treatments are not curative. Understanding the biological reasons for why these treatments do not work or become ineffective is important to identify better ways to treat patients. This presentation will give an overview of our current understanding of why prostate cancers develop resistance to current therapies. <br /><br />SPEAKER: Dr. Paul Toren completed his medical school at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and his urology residency and a clinical uro-oncology fellowship at the University of Toronto. Subsequently, he completed a two-year research fellowship at the Vancouver Prostate Centre under the mentorship of Dr. Martin Gleave. Concurrently, he enrolled in and recently completed a doctorate in experimental medicine in the laboratory of Dr. Amina Zoubeidi.  Since 2015, he works as a clinician-scientist in the Department of Surgery at Laval University, where his laboratory focuses on translational prostate cancer research.<br /><br />Order or download our B brochure here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.prostatecancer.ca/Supporting-You/Resources/Booklets-Brochures">http://www.prostatecancer.ca/Supporting-You/Resources/Booklets-Brochures</a><br /><br />Learn more about Prostate Cancer Canada's Expert Angle here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.prostatecancer.ca/ExpertAngle">http://www.prostatecancer.ca/ExpertAngle</a>{% endraw %}
