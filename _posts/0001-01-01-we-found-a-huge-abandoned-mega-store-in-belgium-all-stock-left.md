Called the local shopping center, we rather thought it was more of an MEGA store instead of a mall where you would expect elevators etc. Apparently, the abandoned house of the owner was attached to the MEGA store, but unfortunately, we missed out on it.<br />Electricity still worked and all stock was shockingly left behind, left to decay and cover in mold. <br /><br />If you like our content, consider to subscribe to our channel and click the bell notification button in case you don't want to miss out! <br />Next video online THIS SATURDAY 10 AM ET!<br /><br />FOLLOW our SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ExplomoYT/">https://www.facebook.com/ExplomoYT/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/explomo_urbex/">https://www.instagram.com/explomo_urbex/</a><br /><br />All the music in this video is gathered through Epidemic Sound (ES).<br /><br />Abandoned Belgium: We found a huge abandoned MEGA STORE in Belgium (ALL STOCK LEFT!)<br />#abandoned #urbex #explomo #abandonedstore{% endraw %}
