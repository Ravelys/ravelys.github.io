Includes YULT Sub remix<br /><br /><br /><br />Video Produced by Swarm<br /><br />Directed by Tom Robinson<br /><br /><br /><br />LYRICS: <br /><br /><br /><br />My early morning dreams don't matter and seem jocular,<br /><br />shattered as the letterbox clatters like the outside world just spat at me.<br /><br />See, I'm popular with credit card companies<br /><br />final-warning me I can't afford to live comfortably.<br /><br />There's bills for gas, tax and electric<br /><br />can't expect my clothes to wash themselves,<br /><br />responsibility's kicked in.<br /><br />Dust gathers on the shelves, pots pile up in the kitchen,<br /><br />I don't want to just survive on a nine-to-five<br /><br />there's something missing.<br /><br />I thought I'd paint a masterpiece,<br /><br />I thought I'd swim the English Channel,<br /><br />thought I'd firework my way through life<br /><br />or be a human cannonball.<br /><br />But I'm too busy spinning plates,<br /><br />getting dizzy but can't stop in case one breaks.<br /><br /> <br /><br />My nine-to-five's an eight-to-six<br /><br />and by the time I've made the trip to work and back,<br /><br />sat in traffic, I'm exhausted.<br /><br />Fuming at the thought of a life led hand to mouth,<br /><br />just consuming's not enough, I know there's more to it.<br /><br />I need to do the things I love, that make me buzz to my core.<br /><br />I need more free time, but I can't afford it.<br /><br />I thought I'd be an Olympian, thought I'd write the next great novel,<br /><br />thought I'd stride across continents and laugh at any obstacle.<br /><br />But no, cause I'm too busy spinning plates,<br /><br />getting dizzy but can't stop in case one breaks.<br /><br />No, I'm much too busy spinning plates,<br /><br />getting dizzy but can't stop<br /><br />just in case one breaks.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm spinning plates, I'm losing patience.<br /><br />It's so mundane with this same rotation.<br /><br />Stuck in a loop, but I can't stop in case I break one.<br /><br /><br /><br />No, I'm too busy spinning plates,<br /><br />but can't stop in case one breaks.<br /><br />No, I'm much too busy spinning plates,<br /><br />but can't stop in case one breaks.{% endraw %}
