That’s because it’s usually our own insecurities that’s causing us to make those judgments in the first place. If we feel like someone’s ignoring us, then all these thoughts start going through our heads. We start thinking “that person thinks that they’re better than us”, or “it’s because I’m not successful enough, I’m not rich enough, I don’t have enough status or followers or it’s the way I look. Maybe something I said or the way I dress or act”. All of these thoughts race through or minds. But in reality our judgments have very little to do with the truth. They’re based on our own deep insecurities about ourselves, rather than how someone else feels about us. There could be one thousand other explanations, but we focus on the one thing that we feel is undesirable about ourselves. <br /><br />💥 Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞ ➞ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DharMannYouTube">http://bit.ly/DharMannYouTube</a> **Make sure you click the bell icon so you can get notifications when my next video goes up so you don’t miss anything! <br /><br />FOLLOW ME: life tips, relationship tips, business tips, plus much more!
