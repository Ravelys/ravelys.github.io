{% raw %}Ascension Presents continues its study on Mary through the month of May in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre of Saint Mary, the traditional spot of her assumption. Dr. Edward Sri, presenter of Mary: A Biblical Walk with the Blessed Mother, explains that even though there is no biblical reference to Mary’s assumption, Scripture does tell us that other biblical characters such as Enoch and Elijah were taken up into heaven after living holy lives. Mary’s assumption into heaven shows that she shared in her son’s victory over death.  Since she was the first in the New Testament to hear God’s word and remained faithful through her life, it’s only fitting that she should go ahead of us. Taken from Mary: A Biblical Walk with the Blessed Mother. <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpresents">https://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpresents</a><br /><br />MORE FROM ASCENSION:<br /><br />Ascension Press main website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ascensionpress.com">http://ascensionpress.com</a><br />Ascension Presents website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ascensionpresents.com">http://ascensionpresents.com</a><br />Ascension Press YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpress">http://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpress</a><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AscensionPress/">https://www.facebook.com/AscensionPress/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/AscensionPress">http://twitter.com/AscensionPress</a><br />LinkedIn:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ascension-press">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ascension-press</a>{% endraw %}
