{% raw %}///soo I'm finally glad I finished a 2D animation again!! After graduating from university -where I mostly concentrated on 3D- I wanted to do some stylized 2D animations again c:<br />This project sadly started off as some kind of coping-project, dealing with the death of my cat. I designed this bat upside-down creature a while ago, and they came back into my mind while listening to Rusty Cages Song 'There isn't any God' which I heard a lot during dealing with my cats' death. Well, some people might find this a strange combination, but it did somehow help. However, I used the misheard lyrics 'There isn't any Garden' as the title instead, to avoid any controversy. SO please, do me a favor and don't make the comment section a war about believes, alright?c: <br /><br />Leon died on my birthday, and it was a very, very hard day as I'm sure he got poisoned. I did absolutely everything I could, would have given up my whole savings for a chance of survival, but there was no use…<br />Cats are beautiful creatures. <br /><br />Credits:<br />ORIGINAL SONG:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPsHPw0wvQI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPsHPw0wvQI</a><br />I edited it a tiny bit. <br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________<br />►Disrespectful comments will be deleted <br />► &quot;Copyright Disclaimer, Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for 'fair use' for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
