{% raw %}As an expert in the field of college application, Alex Chang discusses the secret behind successful college applications. He explains colleges’ mindset when looking through the applications, and how grades are not as important as what most people believe. He also talks about how it is important for the applicants to “be awesome” and be unique in order to get into “dream colleges.”  Alex Chang is the founder and CEO of Ivy-Way Academy. He received his bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Harvard University and continued his studies at the Harvard University Graduate School of Education. He started his own company in his senior year of college, and left his role as the Head Teaching Fellow at Harvard University in order to focus on education. Now, with 12 years of teaching experience, Alex looks forward to share his knowledge on college application processes.<br /><br />TEDxSMICSchool 2018 was organized by a team of 19 students at the SMIC School in Shanghai, China led by executive team members Wesley Ding (Lead Organizer), Kai Yi Mok (Communications), Jay Jung (Finance), and Victoria Liu (Design).
