{% raw %}The Earth is only 29% land, the rest of it is all water, everywhere, which is why it’s not surprising that we’ve barely explored it! Divers, researchers, and scientists study the waters of the Earth, and make new shocking discoveries all the time! While a lot of these discoveries have proper reasoning behind them, there are some that really throw everyone off… From an entire military fleet, and an unexpected graveyard, to the literal Abyss… here are 12 underwater discoveries that can’t be explained!<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “15 Pets Who Fiercely Protected Their Owners”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/p9NGjnv0eug">https://youtu.be/p9NGjnv0eug</a><br />Watch our “12 Weirdest Animal Eggs In The World”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8Qrzd74sG0k">https://youtu.be/8Qrzd74sG0k</a><br />Watch our “15 Deep Sea Creatures You Never Want To Meet”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/99XTnzZN1cg">https://youtu.be/99XTnzZN1cg</a><br /><br />Underwater Military Fleet<br /><br />Micronesia isn’t really a place we hear about a lot. That’s because it’s a little island in the pacific ocean that just gets by on its own without causing too much trouble. However, it wasn’t always like that. In fact, back when World War 2 was at its peak, it was one of the main areas where the American and Japanese forces faced off! Both sides suffered pretty major losses, but it was ultimately the Japanese forces that faced the brunt of the hit… <br /><br />Eventually, the war ended, and everyone moved on… everyone but the families of the Japanese soldiers that weren’t just lost because they died in the war, but also because their bodies weren’t found… well, until 1969, when Jacques Cousteau went to explore the area… He found entire vessels, intact, and full of all the things that the ships sank with… including the bodies of over 400 soldiers… Although the discovery was reported and all the bodies were tracked and sent back to Japan for a proper funeral, no one can really explain why and how 400 bodies were just forgotten and left at sea… <br /><br />Squid Graveyard <br /><br />In 2012, scientists led a deep-sea expedition off the coast of the Gulf of California. They didn’t really expect to make a discovery, and thought they were just going to study the ocean, but ended up making a strange discovery… Hundreds of Squid carcasses were covering the floor of the ocean. That’s something that they had never seen before, and the squids didn’t look like they were poisoned or hit with something… it was as if the squids came there to die, with all of their friends and family members… <br /><br />This could’ve been a fluke, but 3 years later, they went again, and saw that the graveyard had grown even bigger! To this day, scientists are baffled by what this place really is, and how it even exists… so it’s just been dubbed a “squid graveyard” instead… <br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
