I’m Neal Fullerton from musicalteambuilding.com and I’ve been working with conferences and events for international companies and organisations for 15 years. As a musician, I can tell you that making music with others is all about teamwork. It's about listening to each other, communicating and playing your part.<br /><br />Just focus on your part and you'll see that as a team, we can make something pretty cool happen. Using music this way, we can transform your audience into participants. With everyone focusing on a shared task, and actually mastering the piece of music together you can create a really powerful team spirit. Why, we can even get the whole group singing together as one! <br /><br />So whether you want an icebreaker to get everyone talking, an unusual team building activity or an energiser after lunch to re-focus everyone - musical team building is a great way to do it. Click on the link now to visit the website and let’s make your next conference a huge success.{% endraw %}
