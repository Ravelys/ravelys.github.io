Influenced by the writings of Booker T Washington, he pushed back against the philosophy of the NAACP and W.E.B. Du Bois. On the one hand, he was a passionate and fierce leader who unified the community and worked to fight injustice. On the other hand, he was a separatist to the core, a philosophy that led to him reaching out to the Ku Klux Klan. And that's never the best sentence to hear. But love him or hate him, there is no denying that he was extremely influential on figures like Malcolm X. <br /> <br />___________<br /><br />Support the people who make this show, vote for future Extra History topics, and get great perks at our Patreon! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/EHPatreon">http://bit.ly/EHPatreon</a> <br /><br />Subscribe &amp; ! to our channel on YouTube at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubToEC">http://bit.ly/SubToEC</a><br />Got more info about Extra Credits on our website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://extracredits.site/">http://extracredits.site/</a><br />Grab your Extra Credits gear at the store! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://extracredits.store/">http://extracredits.store/</a><br />___________<br /><br />Thanks for participating in this week's discussion!
