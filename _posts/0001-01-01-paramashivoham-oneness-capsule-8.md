{% raw %}Come &amp; Experience Paramashivoham. Visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paramashivoham.innerawakening.org">http://paramashivoham.innerawakening.org</a><br /><br />The word ‘Darshan’ means ‘to have a glimpse of’. Having Darshan of an Avatar can cleanse the karmas of lifetimes, and create a deep and lasting transformation in the receiver.<br /><br />Darshan is something far beyond mere physical ‘seeing’. Darshan is the powerful superconscious vibration that is present around an Avatar at all times. It is a word that cannot be translated; it has to be experienced.<br /><br />During Darshan, His Divine Holiness Paramahamsa Nithyananda creates Mandalas with His hands. Mandalas are secret decoded Agamic energy circuits that harness the multi-dimensional energy of the universe. The energy He creates falls on you and settles in your system.<br /><br />Even if the Mandala enters into your system three times, you will manifest powers and powerful cognitions. Nothing more is required other than a ferocious intention to manifest them.<br /><br />Paramahamsa Nithyananda has breathed life into these videos - Even if you were not physically present during Darshan, just by watching this video, you will experience Kundalini Awakening, manifestation of powers &amp; the ultimate experience of Oneness - Advaita.<br /><br />During these sessions, Paramashiva manifests through Paramahamsa Nithyananda intensely. Look carefully through your Third Eye, as you watch this Oneness Capsule, you will powerfully experience the energy. Look through the Third Eye, lightly but intensely, like how you would look at a rose.<br /><br />These Darshans do not have a past, present or future. They are just happening, there is no ‘was’ or ‘will’ for these happenings. Just by watching, you can get the same experience as watching it live, in-person.<br /><br />To get a live experience of this Darshan come &amp; experience Paramashivoham.<br /><br />Watch, share and like the videos and Subscribe to our channel to be notified of the next upload.<br />click <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/20j90wr">http://bit.ly/20j90wr</a> to subscribe.<br /><br />Website and Social Media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nithyananda.org">http://www.nithyananda.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nithyananda.tv">http://www.nithyananda.tv</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.innerawakening.org">http://www.innerawakening.org</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SriNithyananda">https://twitter.com/SriNithyananda</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda">https://www.facebook.com/ParamahamsaNithyananda</a><br /><br />Paramashivoham: 22-day Ultimate Spiritual Journey with the Avatar HDH Nithyananda Paramashivam <br />Learn more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paramashivoham.nithyananda.org">https://paramashivoham.nithyananda.org</a>{% endraw %}
