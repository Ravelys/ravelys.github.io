{% raw %}There is a very common problem with long-term investors that needs addressing.<br /><br />Because long term investing strategy seems to confuse a lot of people who quickly mix it up with joining a company fan club.<br /><br />Long term investing is seen as a fundamentally different investing strategy to value investing or growth investing, but in reality those differences are not as pronounced as people sometimes think.<br /><br />Long term investing strategy has the same goals as other types of investing - to get the best possible return on investment from the stock market.<br /><br />And if you want to get the best possible return from the stock market, even if you are a long term investor, you have to know the point at which you will sell the stock and if you ever reach that point and you decide there is not a reason to continue holding, then you should sell.<br /><br />üíµ GREAT INVESTING APPS I USE<br /><br />GET A FREE SHARE WORTH UP TO $150 WITH STAKE (UK, Australia, NZ)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hellostake.pxf.io/qnA3xq">https://hellostake.pxf.io/qnA3xq</a><br />You will get a free share if you sign up using this link and deposit a minimum of ¬£50.<br /><br />SIGN UP FOR ETORO (Global investing app)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://med.etoro.com/B15358_A95689_TClick_SSasha.aspx">https://med.etoro.com/B15358_A95689_TClick_SSasha.aspx</a><br />67% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.
