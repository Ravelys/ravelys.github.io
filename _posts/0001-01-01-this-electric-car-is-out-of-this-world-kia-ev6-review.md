{% raw %}Since we took a first look at the new Kia EV6 we've been desperate to take it out on the roads and it did not disappoint, But what makes the EV6 so special in a market awash with electric SUVs?<br /><br />As the car that has the task of single-handedly reinventing the Kia brand, and having to follow the success of the Kia e-Niro - the EV6 has a lot of resting on its space-age designed shoulders. Its crazy, Batmobile-style design won't be for everyone, but if one drives past you, we can guarantee you will turn and look.<br /><br />So, what do we think? This is an extremely impressive, well-rounded and thoughtfully designed electric family car that has been successful in transforming the Kia brand to be more luxurious, tech-focused and sporty whilst maintaining the practical features they are known for. We really, really like it, but what do you think?
