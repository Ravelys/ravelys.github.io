{% raw %}The Quickwire switch and load connectors are designed to connect up twin and earth (twin and CPC) cables in lighting circuits for say an LED fitting. These Quickwire conductors replace all the connection made in a ceiling rose and pendant using the 3 plate method. You have connections for the power In and out (feed in and out), the cable to the switch and cable to the light fitting. This can also be called a 3-way splitter feed in, feed out, switch drop and lighting load connections. <br /><br />This video shows you how to change a ceiling rose and pendant to an LED fitting using the Quickwire switch and load connectors<br /><br />Also the Quickwire brand have a 4-way splitter for power distribution and a T connector that is designed to connect up to two twin and earth (twin and CPC) cables in lighting circuits to a flexible cable for say an LED downlight or spotlight.<br /><br />üîµ Quickwire T Connector and Twin and Earth Strippers Makes Life Easy When Fitting LED Downlights <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AfU53k3qc28">https://youtu.be/AfU53k3qc28</a><br /><br />The Quickwire junction box are maintenance free and can be an alternative to Collingwood easy fit connectors and Wago box‚Äôs with 221 connectors etc.<br /><br />üîµ Electrical Testing Safe Isolation Procedure for a Single Phase Lighting Circuit (How to Isolate) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HJJmEbo4Nzw">https://youtu.be/HJJmEbo4Nzw</a><br /><br />== üïê Time Stamps - Cut to the action üïï ==<br /><br />00:00 - Quickwire switch and load connectors<br />00:40 - Connection inside a ceiling rose and pendant <br />01:21 - Using the loop terminal <br />02:23 - The cables<br />03:10 - Twin and earth cable strippers<br />03:54 - The connecting holes<br />05:24 - Connecting the switch<br />06:11 - Connecting the new LED fitting<br /> <br />Videos are training aids for City and Guilds (C and G) and EAL courses Level 1, 2, 3 plus AM2, AM2S and AM2E. <br /><br />You can follow me day by day on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok lookout for &quot;GSH Electrical‚Äù.  <br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è FACEBOOK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/gshelectrical/">https://www.facebook.com/gshelectrical/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/p/BrIhZmrAYGDTmjMdb9lUNQodMevqsbDDki3qpQ0/">https://instagram.com/p/BrIhZmrAYGDTmjMdb9lUNQodMevqsbDDki3qpQ0/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/gsh_electrical">https://mobile.twitter.com/gsh_electrical</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è TikTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRBLFdhe/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRBLFdhe/</a><br /><br />#GSHElectrical #Electricaltrainingvideos{% endraw %}
