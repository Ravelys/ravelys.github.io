{% raw %}As the saying goes, vicious suppression will Kill a thousand enemies and lose eight hundred. Under strong pressure, Huawei has suffered tremendous losses, and there are times when country M can’t sustain it. With the destruction of the global semiconductor industry supply chain by country M, the problem of global chip shortages has become more and more obvious. Country M has first released the ban on some domestic semiconductor giants. According to foreign media reports, country M has also released TSMC to supply Huawei. , But only for products with 28nm and above process. It is reported that the SOC chips of Huawei's Internet of Things products, such as TVs, cameras, and set-top boxes, all use processes above 28nm.<br /><br />At present, TSMC and Samsung, which have high-end chip supply channels, are restricted from supplying to Huawei. Country M is attacking Huawei, and by the way semiconductor giants such as TSMC and Samsung are harvested to force the transfer of advanced semiconductor technology to the country of M. The world's advanced semiconductor technology has formed a technological hegemony{% endraw %}
