Alan Fitzpatrick’s decorated release catalogue and steadfast come up outshone the underground techno diaspora, placing him firmly on the world stage as a headline artist garnering international reverence and undeniable industry support. <br /><br />A new sound has emerged from Fitzpatrick’s sonic palette; broader in its range and rooted in experiments with more soulful or deeper influences from across electronica, breakbeat, dub and house. A sound that sits comfortably among the rich, depth-charged records being released by the aforementioned Anjunadeep. <br /><br />‘Warning Signs’ is the collaborative effort of both Fitzpatrick and Lawrence Hart, the pair’s debut with the label is a twisting house menagerie with dazzling and thought-provoking sound design. The arrangement rises with groove-stricken drum programming and interweaving atmospheric details, sub-atomic bassline stabs walk hauntingly beneath the composition’s main body.<br /><br />Every element fluently communicating with its counterpart is what makes this track truly special, appearing to breathe and fluctuate as the melody opens up alongside a flurry of hi-hats and hypnotic vocal hooks. “I first heard Lawrence’s voice in 2015, when I received the promo of ‘Call It Love’ by George Fitzgerald. I was immediately blown away” says Alan.<br /><br />Moonlit arpeggiators will carry the record into a crescendo of paradisiacal strings and warping low end frequencies, the pair have cultivated the perfect antidote to a year without clubland as we wish our progression back to normal life can be as starry-eyed as this arrangement.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Director/Edit: Natalia Alejarra<br />D.O.P: Alina Kolosova<br />Dancers: Alice Marriott &amp; Jonny Aubrey-Bentley<br />AD: Max Xaver<br />Gaffer: Adam Jasinski<br /><br />----<br /><br />Follow Anjunadeep:<br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/DeepSubcc">http://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/DeepSubcc</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.anjunadeep.com">http://www.anjunadeep.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep">http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/anjunadeep">http://www.twitter.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/NewReleasesYo/spotify">https://Anjunadeep.lnk.to/NewReleasesYo/spotify</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep">http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep">http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/AboveandBeyond/">https://reddit.com/r/AboveandBeyond/</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/anjuna">https://www.twitch.tv/anjuna</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.discord.gg/anjuna">http://www.discord.gg/anjuna</a><br />#AlanFitzpatrick{% endraw %}
