{% raw %}It's episode 242 and, as humans, we mustn't get too technologied, at least according to Em's UFO story! This week they're taking us to the Ariel school in Zimbabwe to cover a UFO sighting experienced by an entire playground of children. Then Christine brings us part one in a two part series on the infamous case of Laci and Scott Peterson. And did Christine have her baby during this episode? We wouldn't blame you for skipping to the end to find out... and that's why we drink!{% endraw %}
