{% raw %}Every single object is made of different materials that have observable properties. This Miniclip sorts and groups materials based on observable properties such as colour, texture, and flexibility. <br /><br />Students are encouraged to think about the suitability of materials for different purposes, such as clothing and housing, through the examination of materials such as paper, wood, plastic, metal, glass, fabric, and rubber.<br /><br />About ClickView:<br />We cover every level of learning - primary, secondary, and tertiary, and are ready to help you and your students achieve greater outcomes.
