{% raw %}Marine biologists still can't explain what was responsible for eating a Great White Shark whole. Today, we take a look at what was a responsible for eating this Great White Shark whole.<br /><br />Early fossil records show that sharks have been around for over 450 million years, meaning they outlived the dinosaurs, and that makes them some of Earth's most ancient creatures. Sharks are underappreciated for their positive impacts on marine environments, and they are also massively misunderstood.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
