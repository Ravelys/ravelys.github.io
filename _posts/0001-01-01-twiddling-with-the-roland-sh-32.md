{% raw %}This is simply an example of some of what the Roland SH-32 can do. While playing around with the saw wave I chose the SuperSaw (variation #12) for both oscillators and made a nice sweeping pad with the envelope controlling the filter cutoff frequency. After that I chose saw variation #11 for both oscillators and tried to come up with a fat bass sound.{% endraw %}
