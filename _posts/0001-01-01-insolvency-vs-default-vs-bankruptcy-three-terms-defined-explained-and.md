{% raw %}A one minute video through which insolvency, default and bankruptcy have been defined, explained and compared.<br /><br />Way too many people make the mistake of thinking that insolvency, default or bankruptcy are just three words which basically mean the same thing. That is definitely not the case.<br /><br />As we're about to find out:<br /><br />1) Insolvency is a state of being<br /><br />2) A default is an event<br /><br />3) A bankruptcy is a legal process<br /><br />While there are definitely similarities between insolvency, default and bankruptcy, the terms are by no means interchangeable.<br /><br />Please like, comment and subscribe if you've enjoyed this video.<br /><br />To support the channel, give me a minute (see what I did there?) of your time by visiting OneMinuteEconomics.com and reading my message.<br /><br />Bitcoin donations can be sent to 1AFYgM8Cmiiu5HjcXaP5aS1fEBJ5n3VDck and PayPal donations to oneminuteeconomics@gmail.com, any and all support is greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Oh and I've also started playing around with Patreon, my link is:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteeconomics">https://www.patreon.com/oneminuteeconomics</a><br /><br />Interested in reading a good book?<br /><br />My first book, Wealth Management 2.0 (through which I do my best to help people manage their wealth properly, whether we're talking about someone who has a huge amount of money at his disposal or someone who is still living paycheck to paycheck), can be bought using the links below:<br /><br />Amazon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Management-2-0-Financial-Professionals-ebook/dp/B01I1WA2BK">https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Management-2-0-Financial-Professionals-ebook/dp/B01I1WA2BK</a><br /><br />Barnes &amp; Noble - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wealth-management-20-andrei-polgar/1124435282?ean=2940153328942">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/wealth-management-20-andrei-polgar/1124435282?ean=2940153328942</a><br /><br />iBooks (Apple) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itun.es/us/wYSveb.l">https://itun.es/us/wYSveb.l</a><br /><br />Kobo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.kobobooks.com/en-us/ebook/wealth-management-2-0">https://store.kobobooks.com/en-us/ebook/wealth-management-2-0</a><br /><br />My second book, the Wall Street Journal and USA Today bestseller The Age of Anomaly (through which I help people prepare for financial calamities and become more financially resilient in general), can be bought using the links below.<br /><br />Amazon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Anomaly-Spotting-Financial-Uncertainty-ebook/dp/B078SYL5YS">https://www.amazon.com/Age-Anomaly-Spotting-Financial-Uncertainty-ebook/dp/B078SYL5YS</a><br /><br />Barnes &amp; Noble - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-age-of-anomaly-andrei-polgar/1127084693?ean=2940155383970">https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-age-of-anomaly-andrei-polgar/1127084693?ean=2940155383970</a><br /><br />iBooks (Apple) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/age-anomaly-spotting-financial-storms-in-sea-uncertainty/id1331704265">https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/age-anomaly-spotting-financial-storms-in-sea-uncertainty/id1331704265</a><br /><br />Kobo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kobo.com/ww/en/ebook/the-age-of-anomaly-spotting-financial-storms-in-a-sea-of-uncertainty">https://www.kobo.com/ww/en/ebook/the-age-of-anomaly-spotting-financial-storms-in-a-sea-of-uncertainty</a><br /><br />Last but not least, if you'd like to follow me on social media, use one of the links below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/oneminuteeconomics">https://www.facebook.com/oneminuteeconomics</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/andreipolgar">https://twitter.com/andreipolgar</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ro.linkedin.com/in/andrei-polgar-9a11a561">https://ro.linkedin.com/in/andrei-polgar-9a11a561</a>{% endraw %}
