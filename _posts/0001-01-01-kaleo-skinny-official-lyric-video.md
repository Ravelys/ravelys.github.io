{% raw %}Music and Lyrics by JJ Julius Son<br />From the new album Surface Sounds out now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kaleo.lnk.to/surfacesounds">https://kaleo.lnk.to/surfacesounds</a><br /><br />What makes you feel good?<br />What makes you angry inside?<br /> <br />Why don’t you love me?<br />You want to fuck me or fight?<br /> <br />You never asked me<br />If I had something to hide<br /> <br />You want to hurt me<br />I’ll make it easy tonight<br /> <br />You’ve got to stay skinny<br />Don’t you, girl?<br />You’ve got to stay pretty<br />While you can<br />You’ve got to stay hungry<br />For the fans<br /> <br />Or they’ll try to burn you all out<br />They’ll try to burn you all out<br /> <br />Your face is rotten<br />Ugliest smile I have seen<br /> <br />Your name is forgotten<br />Now go on and cut yourself clean<br /> <br />Why won’t you answer?<br />You think you’re better than me?<br /> <br />Go on surrender<br />Another suicide teen<br /> <br />You’ve got to stay skinny<br />Don’t you girl<br />You’ve got to stay pretty<br />As you were<br />You know we are living<br />In a fucked up world<br /> <br />And they’ll try to burn you all up<br />They’re going to burn you all up<br /> <br />Oh I’m burning out now<br />Oh I’m burning out<br />Can you feel me burning out<br />Oh I’m burning out<br /> <br />You’ve got to stay skinny<br />Don’t you girl<br />You’ve got to stay pretty<br />While you can<br />You know we are living<br />In this fucked up world<br /> <br />And they’re going to burn you all up<br />They’re going to burn you all out{% endraw %}
