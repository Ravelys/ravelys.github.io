{% raw %}Socks, t-shirts, and underwear are the 3 most requested items in homeless shelters. That’s why we donate one for every Bombas item you purchase. So whenever you gift Bombas this holiday season, you're not just giving a comfortable, thoughtful gift—you’re also donating essential clothing to those who need it. And that makes this season (and every season) a little warmer and brighter for everyone.{% endraw %}
