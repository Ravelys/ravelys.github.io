{% raw %}ORDER HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarturl.it/CognizanceBand">https://smarturl.it/CognizanceBand</a><br /><br />COGNIZANCE return with their sophomore album UPHEAVAL . Their signature sound of modern death metal laced with undeniable groove and technical prowess seals the deal that they’re ones to watch on the thriving UK death metal scene. <br /><br />Despite UPHEAVAL channelling an all out riff-driven assault, the record is embellished by a rich sense of melody, emotive guitar solos and some of the most punishing vocals in the genre. COGNIZANCE once again demonstrates that speed and technicality can fully embrace groove and hooks - to compelling effect. UPHEAVAL was mixed and mastered by legendary Swedish producer Fredrik Nordstrom (At The Gates, Architects, Dimmu Borgir), adding the final cutting edge to the record.<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />I find myself drifting<br />Narrowly avoiding immediate observation<br />Transfixed by what could be<br />Bias embedded deep into my skull<br />Inter dimensional interference<br />Consuming all<br />Distorting into self-induced fiction<br />Architecture of madness<br />A deceitful concoction<br />Tearing apart the great framework of our limited existence<br />Immaterial restraint twisting the corridor of time<br />An ethos diminished to extinction<br />Foreshadowed by frenetic tendencies<br />Divergent philosophies emerging<br />A sign of the times<br />Aeon sickness<br />Affinity to the toxins I breed<br />Self made horror<br />Unwelcome occupant<br />Self made horror through Aeon Sickness<br /><br />Distorting into self induced fiction<br />Architecture of madness<br />A deceitful concoction<br /><br />Tearing apart the great framework of our limited existence<br />Immaterial restraint twisting the perceived corridor of time<br />Frozen in a feedback loop<br />The body changes in composition<br />While horrors grow ever present<br />Battling with anecdotal memories<br />An ethos diminished to extinction<br />Frenetic bias<br />All consuming misery<br />Aeon sickness<br />Affinity to the toxins I breed<br />Self made horror<br />Unwelcome occupant<br />Aeon Sickness.<br /><br />Cognizance is;<br /><br />Henry Pryce – Vocals<br />Alex Baillie – Guitar<br />Apostolis &quot;Yage&quot; Karydis – Guitar<br />Chris Binns – Bass<br />David Diepold - Drums{% endraw %}
