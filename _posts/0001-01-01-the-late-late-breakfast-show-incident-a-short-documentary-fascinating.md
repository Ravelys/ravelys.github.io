{% raw %}On the 13th of November 1986, BBC employees were rehearsing a stunt for an upcoming episode of The Late Late Breakfast Show. The spot would see a member of the public carrying out a movie-style stunt after a week of intensive training. It was a popular segment… but on this occasion it would end up going very, very wrong.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:36 - About The Late Late Breakfast Show<br />03:40 - The Incident<br />06:45 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
