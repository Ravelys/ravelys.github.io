{% raw %}► SPONSOR THIS VIDEO: footballdailyuk@gmail.com<br /><br />On this week’s Sunday Vibes, the team discusses Manchester United’s tricky start to the season - and the potentially fatal run of games Ole has coming up (Liverpool, Tottenham, Man City)!<br /><br />Will further losses cost the Norwegian, who has now been in the United hot seat for three years, the top job - or has he built up enough credit with the United hierarchy to see the season out?<br /><br />If it’s the former, how should United go about rebuilding the club (having already spent £400m in the last three years)? If it’s the latter - what changes does Ole need to make to turn things round?<br /><br />Other ground covered: the lingering Conte rumours, the Ronaldo conundrum and United’s double pivot.<br /><br />Oh - and our favourite TV shows of 2021.<br /><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/fdsubscribe">http://bit.ly/fdsubscribe</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to EURO FOOTBALL DAILY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/37igEnb">https://bit.ly/37igEnb</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY PODCASTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3moyeMO">https://bit.ly/3moyeMO</a><br /><br />► JOIN THE FAN RUN FD FAMILY DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA">https://discord.gg/KH5YMxA</a><br /><br />► SIGN UP FOR A FREE SMARTERSCOUT MEMBERSHIP HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarterscout.com/">https://smarterscout.com/</a><br /><br />This is Football Daily - the home of Premier League fan analysis on YouTube.
