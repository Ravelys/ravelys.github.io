Because in order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling&quot; - Brené Brown<br /><br />2. &quot;Either we heal as a team or we’re gonna crumble, inch by inch, play by play, till we’re finished. We’re in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And we can stay here and get the $&amp;#@ kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb out of hell, one inch at a time.&quot; - Al Pacino<br /><br />3. &quot;Don't ever let somebody tell you ... you can't do something. Not even me. Alright? You got a dream. You gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you can't do it. If you want something, go get it. Period.&quot; - Will Smith<br /><br />Use these hashtags to find more of our motivational videos:<br /><br />1. #TonyRobbinsMotivation<br />3. #Lawofattraction<br />3. #Actionbeginssuccess<br /><br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br /><br />* Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
