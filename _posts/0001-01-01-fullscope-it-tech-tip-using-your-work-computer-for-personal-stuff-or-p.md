{% raw %}It’s easy to become a little more relaxed when working from the comfort of your living room, the kitchen table or your home office. Surfing over to Facebook, instagram, Twitter, other social media or even your personal e-mail account can be very tempting.  <br />But the ONLY thing you should use your company’s workstation or laptop for is…WORK! <br />Check your personal accounts on YOUR personal device. <br />With over 600,000 Facebook accounts being hacked every day… If you’re using a company device to access a compromised account, you are potentially opening up a door for a hacker who can then get into your company’s network via your e-mail or PC.<br />By the way…  the same principle applies in reverse... if you are using your personal computer to do work stuff.By using your personal device (the same one you use to check your personal g-mail, hotmail facebook &amp; instagram with) to attach to the corporate network.  If your device is compromised.  You can become the weakest link in your companies security and could potentially take the whole network down.If you are issued a company owned workstation, laptop, or notebook.  In a lot of cases… companies will put hidden monitoring software on the device that tracks everything.   <br />That’s right...So keep the two separate.{% endraw %}
