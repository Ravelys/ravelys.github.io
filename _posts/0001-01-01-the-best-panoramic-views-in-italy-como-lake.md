{% raw %}Lake Como, located about 80 kilometers from “Milan” between the provinces of “Como and Lecco”, is the third-largest lake in Italy, after “Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore”, and the deepest. The lake, one of the most important in Lombardy, with its characteristic upside-down Y shape, is divided into three branches: “Como” to the southwest, “Lecco” to the southeast and “Colico” to the north. Its shores offer many fascinating views: picturesque villages, splendid villas and lush gardens await visitors seeking relax and culture in contact with nature. In “Como”, the town from which the lake takes its name, the “Silk Didactic Museum” is well worth to visit: here you can discover evidence of Como’s textile production tradition. A succession of splendid villas line, the shores of the lake, a holiday destination for the Lombard nobility since the 16th century. Como is also considered to be the birthplace of Italian artistic and architectural rationalism, with numerous examples of modern European architecture such as the Novocomum, the Giuliani Frigerio House, the War Memorial and the former Casa del Fascio, all by the Italian architect Giuseppe Terragni.<br /><br />VISIT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE LAKE COMO:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.romeanditaly.com/como-lake-tour/">https://www.romeanditaly.com/como-lake-tour/</a>{% endraw %}
