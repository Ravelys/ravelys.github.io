{% raw %}If you're old enough to remember this, it was a scary moment in history. If you relived it through movies and documentaries, it seems almost impossible to grasp. But imagine yourself there, standing right in the middle of where this horrific tragedy took place. In April 1986, a reactor at Chernobyl's nuclear power plant exploded, killing 31 people and affecting about 115,000 people. But can you visit Chernobyl today? Are there mutant animals lurking in the area? What is the exclusion zone, and why is it so dangerous?<br /><br /><br />Questions or concerns?
