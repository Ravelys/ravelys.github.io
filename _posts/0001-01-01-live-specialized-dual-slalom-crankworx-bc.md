{% raw %}Watch the Specialized Dual Slalom LIVE from Sun Peaks, British Columbia for Crankworx BC 2021! <br /><br />This crowd-pleasing format pits two competitors against one another in a side-by-side battle against each other and the clock’s cruel hand as racers battle to avoid elimination. Riders take one run down each side of the course, with the fastest combined time taking the win. Each lap through the track raises the stakes and works up everyone’s appetite to win.<br /><br />September 22 – October 2, 2021, Crankworx B.C. will bring some of the world’s top pro riders together to compete at some of the province’s top mountain bike destinations. <br /><br />Crankworx B.C. is a pivot that will provide a temporary replacement for Crankworx Whistler in the Crankworx World Tour calendar in 2021.
