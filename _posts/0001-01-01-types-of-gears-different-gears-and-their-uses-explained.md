{% raw %}Types of Gears: Different Gears and their Uses Explained<br /><br />What is Gear?<br /><br />Gear can be defined as a toothed wheel that can be engaged in another toothed wheel in order to transmit energy that gives the change of speed and direction of motion. It is widely used in mechanical devices. The teeth of the gear are generally carved on wheels, cylinders, or cones.<br /><br />Many devices that we use in our day-to-day life have their own working principle. The tooth and wheel of gear are working parts of all types of gear. The different types of gears are used to complete the transfer of energy in different ways and in different directions.<br /><br />A gear is a component within a transmission device that transmits the rotational force to another gear or device. Gear is different from a pulley in that a gear is a round wheel that has teeth that mesh with other gear teeth. Allowing the force to be fully transferred without slippage.<br /><br />In this video, I'll show some of the types of gears such as:<br />Spur Gears, Helical Gears, Double Helical, Herringbone Gears, Spiral gears, Bevel Gears, Worm Gears, Rack and Pinion gears, and more.<br /><br />---- Time Stamp ---<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:52 - Spur Gear<br />01:30 - Helical Gear<br />02:00 - Double Helical Gear<br />02:30 - Herringbone Gear<br />02:58 - Quick Question #1<br />03:11 - Bevel Gear<br />03:38 - Spiral Bevel Gear<br />04:06 - Miter Gear<br />04:51 - Worm Gear<br />05:54 - Hypoid Gear<br />06:28 - Quick Question #2<br />06:41 - Gear Rack<br />07:21 - Crown Gear<br />08:15 - Internal Gear<br />08:42 - Rack &amp; Pinion<br />09:13 - Quick Question #3<br />09:28 - Epicyclic Gear<br />10:00 - Harmonic Gear<br />10:25 - Cycloid Gear<br />11:09 - Cage Gear<br />12:00 - Magnetic Gear<br />12:55 - Wrap Up<br /><br />Watch our video on type of gearbox: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1xLpuCooSf8">https://youtu.be/1xLpuCooSf8</a><br /><br />More videos on Machines: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rz0iQF">https://bit.ly/3rz0iQF</a><br /><br />How does a Car Engine Work?: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3zuwgjP">https://bit.ly/3zuwgjP</a><br /><br />Download the PDF:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theengineerspost.com/types-of-gears/">https://www.theengineerspost.com/types-of-gears/</a><br /><br />Follow us Facebook:- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fanpageengineerspost">https://www.facebook.com/fanpageengineerspost</a><br /><br />Visit our Website for more articles:-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theengineerspost.com/">https://www.theengineerspost.com/</a><br /><br />Like this video, If you found it useful and share it with your friends, and If you have any questions leave a comment weâ€™ll respond.<br /><br />#Gears #TypesofGears #UseofGears<br /><br />Thanks for watching and subscribe for more.{% endraw %}
