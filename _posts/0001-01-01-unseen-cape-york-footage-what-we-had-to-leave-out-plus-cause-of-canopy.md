{% raw %}Razorback Sale! Get them here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://razorback4x4.com.au/">https://razorback4x4.com.au/</a><br /><br />If you love behind the scenes 4WD 24/7 content - this is a must watch. Hear all the yarns and see footage that we couldn't show in the Cape York episodes from Graham Cahill and Shaun Whale. They'll tell you about the Old Tele Track challenge that they got most bogged at, Nolans Crossing, Palm Creek &amp; Gunshot Creek. How about the snatch strap they snapped, how the 4WD fire started and so much more.{% endraw %}
