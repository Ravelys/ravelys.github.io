{% raw %}The Queen missing the Remembrance Sunday service means we are now seeing a transition to a new royal administration, according to Royal Correspondent Andre Walker.<br /><br />It comes as the Queen missed the Remembrance Sunday service in London because of a strained back.<br /><br />This is the latest in a string of recent public events that sheâ€™s been unable to attend.<br /><br />&quot;She's always said that there are few events, that even if she did retire, she would continue to attend,&quot; Mr Walker told Sky News Australia.<br /><br />&quot;One of them being the state opening of parliament, another, being Remembrance Sunday.<br /><br />&quot;So, I think it is significant to cancel this and I don't think it's something that would've been done just as a precaution, it would be done literally because she's incapable of doing it.<br /><br />&quot;But, and it is an awful thing to say, I think we are now seeing he transition to a new administration, with Prince Charles and Prince William taking much more of a role than they did previously.&quot;{% endraw %}
