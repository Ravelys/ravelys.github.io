{% raw %}Relaxing instrumental music: soft, slow, peaceful and relaxing music for background, work, to focus, study, or simply to relax. Use it as music while you're studying, reading, writing, while being creative, coding, day-dreaming, reviewing, or making little or huge future plans, for your own, your family, or the human race. May you find success and fulfilment in what you do! This music mix 'B-Sides NÂ°1' is a collection of 32 tracks I created during the first 6 months of this relaxdaily project.<br /><br />Have a wonderful time!<br />Michael (relaxdaily*)<br /><br />ðŸŽ§ Find this music 'B-Sides NÂ°1' also on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4LRZZYcGEc1ffww0QcFIxc">https://open.spotify.com/album/4LRZZYcGEc1ffww0QcFIxc</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ§ Tune into my channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily">https://www.youtube.com/relaxdaily</a> (tick the notification bell for updates when subbing)<br /><br />â™¡  You can boost my relaxdaily music project via Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily">https://www.patreon.com/relaxdaily</a><br /><br />Selected popular relaxdaily playlists (save playlist for updates):<br /><br />â˜° relaxdaily calm piano music sessions: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67GDMoL_vHqpXAWIoEoix6k">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67GDMoL_vHqpXAWIoEoix6k</a><br /><br />â˜° all relaxdaily singles: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE6EB41B485F610A</a><br /><br />â˜° relaxdaily music long mixtapes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67J-QPTDWMzXAySwuxXZKq2">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzlQzU-yr67J-QPTDWMzXAySwuxXZKq2</a><br /><br />*Iâ€™m Michael and I love creating music. I play, compose and record mostly calm and peaceful tunes and started sharing these here on YouTube in 2011.<br /><br />Music can be much more than just pure entertainment. It can be a meaningful soundtrack that accompanies us through a moment, through a day, a phase, or through life.<br /><br />Many use my recordings and piano music sessions as background music while reading, doing mind work, to achieve better focus, while studying, while being creative, while coding or designing a product, a service or the world of tomorrow. From your comments I know that my music also works as relaxing music, spa or yoga music, or to set a calm tone at cafes, bars, lounges, in hotels and restaurants, mostly at a low volume.<br /><br />This project is not as much about a genre as it is about a feeling. A way of life. With my tunes, I try to take a little heat and speed from our generally quite busy lives. A soundtrack for you, when you feel the need for a calm and peaceful, light and positive tune, the relaxdaily way.<br /><br />Thank you for tuning in, for liking, sharing and commenting! Thank you for following and supporting what I do!<br /><br /> - Michael a.k.a. relaxdaily<br /><br />Â© music: 2011-2012, relaxdaily | relaxdaily.net<br />Be yourself!<br /><br />#relaxing #music #relaxdaily{% endraw %}
