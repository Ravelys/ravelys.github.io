{% raw %}*** I would like to dedicate this song to all lovers in the world ***<br /><br /><br /><br />Hiding from the rain and snow <br /><br />Trying to forget but I won't let go <br /><br />Looking at a crowded street <br /><br />Listening to my own heart beat <br /><br />So many people all around the world <br /><br />Tell me where do I find someone like you gir <br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />Take me to your soul <br /><br />Give me your hand before I'm old <br /><br />Show me what love is<br /><br />Haven't got a clue <br /><br />Show me that wonders can be true <br /><br />They say nothing lasts forever <br /><br />We're only here today <br /><br />Love is now or never <br /><br />Bring me far away <br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />Take me to your soul <br /><br />Give me your hand and hold me <br /><br />Show me what love is <br /><br />Be my guiding star <br /><br />It's easy <br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />...<br /><br />Standing on a mountain high <br /><br />Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky <br /><br />I should go and see some friends <br /><br />But they don't really comprehend <br /><br />Don't need too much talking <br /><br />Without saying anything <br /><br />All I need is someone <br /><br />Who makes me want to sing<br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />Take me to your soul <br /><br />Give me your hand before I'm old <br /><br />Show me what love is <br /><br />Haven't got a clue <br /><br />Show me that wonders can be true <br /><br />They say nothing lasts forever <br /><br />We're only here today <br /><br />Love is now or never <br /><br />Bring me far away <br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />Take me to your soul <br /><br />Give me your hand and hold me<br /><br />Show me what love is <br /><br />Be my guiding star <br /><br />It's easy <br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />Take me to your heart <br /><br />Take me to your soul <br /><br />Give me your hand and hold me <br /><br />Show me what love is <br /><br />Be my guiding star <br /><br />It's easy <br /><br />Take me to your heart{% endraw %}
