{% raw %}We headed off to try and find a few bits for the Bonneville, so we stopped off in Tenerife’s China Town.<br /><br />After that, we rode along the coast to a great little spot called Soul Kitchen- great coffees, cakes and sandwiches!<br /><br />We saw a number of fantastic vehicles, including a motorcycle and sidecar that I’d never heard of- a Ural.  I also looked at some popular bikes in Tenerife, as well as a few old cars, including an abandoned Mercedes from the 1970/80s!<br /><br />And we stop off at the coast and see where many of the camper vans choose to set up as their base- it’s a really eclectic mix that looks a bit like the scene from an apocalypse movie- fully loaded up vans with roof racks and people living in them, possibly long term.<br /><br />__________________<br /><br />Partner:<br /><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sizzapp.com">https://sizzapp.com</a> <br /><br />(Motorcycle tracker and rider's mate)<br /><br />__________________<br /><br /><br />Timeline:<br /><br />- 0.00 - 3:10: Intro<br />- 3:11 - 4:26: China Town and Bike Parts Shopping<br />- 4:27 - 4:42: Ride to Los Cristianos<br />- 4:43 - 5:55: Ural Motorcycle<br />- 5:56 - 7:38: Ride to Coffee Shop and Vespa<br />- 7:39 - 8:30: Soul Kitchen Coffee Shop<br />- 8:31 - 9:42: Ural Info<br />- 9:43 - 10:57: Seat Marbella<br />- 10:58 - 12:52: Vespa?
