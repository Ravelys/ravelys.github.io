{% raw %}&quot; This is called a Real Branding Campaign &quot;<br /><br />As ‪#‎coca_cola‬ says, &quot;NEXT TIME YOU'RE THIRSTY, DRINK AN AD&quot;<br />A drinkable advertising creates the illusion that you actually taste the campaign and that’s why they collaborated with Shazam, helping the audience enjoy a Coke Zero with the help of technology. By “Shazaming” the ad, viewers see Coke Zero pouring in the screen of their smartphones, filling a glass, which ends up into an actual free Coke Zero that can be redeemed on big retail stores across the US.<br /><br />(Declaration: We do not own any of the copyright or intellectual properties of this video, This is purely for sharing and awareness.
