{% raw %}Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese says he is reminded every time an election is held in a country which has voluntary voting that Australia “got it right when we had compulsory voting”. <br /><br />Speaking to the media on the United States presidential election, Mr Albanese said he was struck by the “consistency in which Americans hold democratic principles so dear, regardless of where they might stand on the political spectrum”. <br /><br />“And I’m very confident that American institutions and indeed the American people will come through this,” he said. <br /><br />“Of course everyone would like to see a result clearly on election night but often that doesn’t happen, they’re still counting votes in Queensland.<br /><br />“I think that democracy is too important for it to be undermined by any individual. <br /><br />“I value our democracy, but I value democratic principles around the world as well.”{% endraw %}
