{% raw %}Making clean energy isnâ€™t enough: We also have to move it.<br /><br />Subscribe and turn on notifications (ðŸ””) so you don't miss any videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/0bsAjO">http://goo.gl/0bsAjO</a><br /><br />In the near future, the energy made in the US is going to be much greener. The countryâ€™s current goal is for solar plants alone to make nearly half of US electricity by 2050. But we canâ€™t just build solar plants where coal and gas plants used to be. They have to be built where it'sâ€¦ sunny. And wind turbines have to be built where itâ€™s windy. The problem is, thatâ€™s not always where the people who need the power are.<br /><br />The distance from energy source to energy need is about to get a lot bigger. And the US is going to need more high-voltage transmission lines. A lot more. As soon as possible. While solar plants can be built relatively fast, high-voltage transmission projects can take up to 10 years. So experts say we need to start proactively building them, right now.<br /><br />Sources and further reading:<br />Much of the map data in the piece comes from the Net-Zero America study out of Princeton University: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/">https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/</a><br /><br />This map from the US Energy Information Association is a good way to see what power plants and high-voltage power lines are near you (if youâ€™re in the US): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eia.gov/state/maps.php">https://www.eia.gov/state/maps.php</a><br /><br />Vermont Public Radio reported on the energy bottleneck we talk about in the very beginning of the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vpr.org/vpr-news/2020-12-15/transmission-grid-bottlenecks-in-northeast-kingdom-stall-solar-development">https://www.vpr.org/vpr-news/2020-12-15/transmission-grid-bottlenecks-in-northeast-kingdom-stall-solar-development</a> <br /><br />And hereâ€™s more about that denied power plant from local Vermont TV station WCAX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Regulators-deny-Derby-solar-project-504867011.html">https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Regulators-deny-Derby-solar-project-504867011.html</a> <br /><br />This other great study is what calculated how much renewable energy potential there is in just those 15 middle states: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Corporate-Demand-and-Transmission-January-2018.pdf">https://acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Corporate-Demand-and-Transmission-January-2018.pdf</a> <br /><br />More about the 2018 Camp Fire in California and the investigation that determined it was started by electrical transmission lines: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/officials-camp-fire-deadliest-in-california-history-was-caused-by-pge-electrical-transmission-lines.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/15/officials-camp-fire-deadliest-in-california-history-was-caused-by-pge-electrical-transmission-lines.html</a> <br /><br />And if you want to get really into the details of how these lines work, I found the Edison Tech Center really helpful: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://edisontechcenter.org/wires.html">https://edisontechcenter.org/wires.html</a> <br /><br />Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
