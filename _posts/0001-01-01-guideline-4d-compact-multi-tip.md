{% raw %}Guideline 4D Compact Multi Tip is a ready-to-fish setup with a floating 4D Compact body and a mesh wallet with three interchangeable tips in various densities. The 4D Compact Multi Tip line is the best and most economical way to get your rig correct from the start when fishing with Multi Tip Shooting Heads connected to a Shooting Line. <br /><br />This set-up consists of a floating 4D Compact Body and a mesh wallet with a set of three interchangeable tips of various sink rates (H/I, S1/S3 and S3/S5) for efficient targeting of fish at different depths. It is a complete range of lines that covers all kinds of fishing from single handed to Switch and all the way up to fishing with double handed rods, except the heaviest line weights and the longest rods. The 4D Compact line is super easy to manage and cast due to its short length. It has a powerful taper and works equally well with both Scandi- and Skagit style casts.<br /><br />Link to website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/products/flylines/multitip/guideline-multi-tip-set/4d-compact-multi-tip-105949-p0000131807">https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/products/flylines/multitip/guideline-multi-tip-set/4d-compact-multi-tip-105949-p0000131807</a>{% endraw %}
