{% raw %}I edited this video because I happened to promise members of the Elementary community on reddit that I will be the one to create this compilation after I'd seen it suggested and wished for many times. I faced difficulties in uploading the video to reddit so I decided to share a YouTube link instead and the video ended up here.<br /> I would say that the main flaw in this compilation is that  it is just that, a compilation. I wish I could do more stylish editing but by the time I finished this I had already spent too much time and I had other things to do, so I decided it should be enough.<br /><br />What most people don't know is that the Holmes-Waking-Up-Watson running gag is in fact canon, i.e, it was taken straight from the original Sherlock Holmes stories. I can remember at least three events where Holmes woke Watson up in the books. The Speckled Band, The Abbey Grange, and The Man With The Twisted Lip. However, Elementary does make a bit too much of a joke out of it.<br /><br />Consider joining the Elementary Discord server<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/UWDeBut">https://discord.gg/UWDeBut</a>{% endraw %}
