Try the Classic Lemon and Honey Solution<br />Sipping on a solution of lemon, honey, and warm water is a classic home remedy that is widely used across the world. It’s useful in alleviating sore throat symptoms that are caused by repeated coughing.<br /><br />➡️ 2. Stay Hydrated<br />More than 70% of the human body is made up of water which is why it’s always important to stay hydrated — especially when a chest infection is present. Dehydration causes the mucus and secretions in the lungs to thicken up which makes it more difficult to cough them up for removal. <br /><br />➡️ 3. Utilize Humidity and Steam Inhalation<br />One reason that symptoms get worse during a chest infection is because of dryness in the nasal passages. Humidity and steam inhalation is a great way to counter this and soothe the airways. A humidifier produces steam and disperses it throughout the room so that it can easily be inhaled into the airways which provides relief and helps loosen up secretions.<br /><br />➡️ 4. Try Herbal Remedies from the Ginger Family<br />When it comes to food-based natural home remedies for a chest infection, ginger is a great one to consider. The roots of a ginger plant are widely used for food and natural medicinal purposes around the world. <br /><br />➡️ 5. Use Natural Essential Oils<br />Using naturally extracted essential oils such as eucalyptus, lemongrass, rosemary, and sandalwood can be effective methods of treating a chest infection. You can use these oils either by inhalation via diffusers, vaping, or by topical application in the form of natural vapor rub.<br /><br />➡️ 6. Remove Mucus Through Postural Drainage<br />One of the most common problems that occur with a chest infection is the accumulation of mucus and phlegm in the chest and the airways, which can lead to shortness of breath, discomfort, and sometimes wheezing. The human body uses coughing as a natural mechanism to get rid of excess mucus. But sometimes, natural coughing is just not enough.<br /><br />➡️ 7. Take Over-the-Counter Medications<br />Natural remedies are great, but if the symptoms are too severe or unbearable, this is when you can look into some over-the-counter medications that can help. They come in various forms such as vapor rubs, pain relievers, and decongestants.<br /><br />💥Full Guide on Natural Chest Infection Treatments ➜ ➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2BC8N7C">https://bit.ly/2BC8N7C</a><br /><br />—————<br /><br />📗 BEST STUDY GUIDES FOR YOU<br />▪ TMC Test Bank 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu">http://bit.ly/2IGeqSu</a><br />▪ Hacking the TMC Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XBc8do">http://bit.ly/2XBc8do</a><br />▪ TMC Exam Bundle (Save $) 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34pqEsV">https://bit.ly/34pqEsV</a><br />▪ Daily TMC Practice Questions 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C">http://bit.ly/2NnXh3C</a><br /><br />💙MORE FROM RTZ<br />▪ Free TMC Practice Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XlwASL">http://bit.ly/2XlwASL</a><br />▪ Free RRT Cheat Sheet 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB">http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB</a><br />▪ Resources for RT's 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo">http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo</a><br />▪ Testimonials 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl">http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl</a><br /><br />🌐FOLLOW US<br />▪ Instagram 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV">http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV</a><br />▪ Twitter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1">http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1</a><br />▪ Facebook 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MSEejt">http://bit.ly/2MSEejt</a><br />▪ Pinterest 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw">http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw</a><br /><br />🚑MEDICAL DISCLAIMER<br />Medicine and Respiratory Therapy are continuously changing practices.
