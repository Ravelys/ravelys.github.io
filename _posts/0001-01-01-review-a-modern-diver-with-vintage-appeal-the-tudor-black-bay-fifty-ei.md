I don't even have to say the names of the watches that started this genre, since you probably spoke them out loud to yourself at the end of my previous sentence. But it's fair to say that for many people, this is what they think of when someone says the word &quot;watch.&quot; The mid-century dive watch, with its rotating timing bezel, it's clean, no-fuss dial, and its sturdy case and bracelet profile, transcends any one watch at this point. It's an idea as much as a thing itself.<br /><br />That's why a watch like the Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight is so interesting to me. Tudor essentially created its modern update to the dive watch in 2012, with the introduction of the Heritage Black Bay. At the time, it was just one watch, but in the nearly eight years since, it's grown into a family of watches at Tudor and a formula for other brands to follow. But while the Black Bay takes a number of cues from old-school dive watches, it doesn't make any attempt to actually be one. It's 41mm across, it's relatively thick, and it's styled in such a way that you'd never mistake it for something from the 1950s. The Black Bay Fifty-Eight is something different entirely.{% endraw %}
