{% raw %}How the automobile differential allows a vehicle to turn a corner while keeping the wheels from skidding.<br /><br />Differential steering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_steering">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_steering</a><br /><br />Differential steering is the means of steering a land vehicle by applying more or less drive torque to one side of the vehicle than the other. Differential steering is the primary means of steering tracked vehicles, such as tanks and bulldozers, is also used in certain wheeled vehicles commonly known as skid-steer, and even implemented in some automobiles, where it is called torque vectoring, to augment steering by changing wheel direction relative to the vehicle. Differential steering is distinct from torque steer, which is usually considered a negative side effect of drive-train design choices.<br /><br />#DifferentialSteering #Chevrolet{% endraw %}
