{% raw %}Got a round back? With your head sticking forward like a turtle? Does your mom tell you to stand straighter? .. might be the case because your are sitting a lot! ♥︎/ Werbung <br /><br />The typical &quot;desk position&quot; can lead to tightness and pain in the neck, back, shoulders, lower back and hips. <br />This routine focusses on correcting the sitting-position and basically bend our body into the opposite direction. This opens the chest, mobilizes the spine, stretches the shoulders and the back. <br /><br />Let's get a better posture! <br />Standing straight instantly makes you look taller, fitter and more confident as well ♥︎<br /><br />_<br /><br />You can do this after any kind of workout, after sitting at your desk for a long time, in the morning or before you go to bed :) there is no &quot;wrong&quot; timing here. <br /><br />No Equipment needed. Just prepare a soft surface like a yoga mat or towel :) .. and a wall haha. <br /><br />__<br /><br />▸ You can find free WORKOUT SCHEDULES on my Instagram Channel.
