{% raw %}I am opening two retail mega boxes of 2021-22 Panini Chronicles Draft Picks Basketball for our next sports card pack opening/product review! These boxes have an SRP of $50 and currently resell in the $50 range. Every box contains 12 5-card packs. Expect 8 exclusive Playoff base cards per box along with chances at exclusive green parallels. These boxes come with chances at pulling the first rookie cards for the 2021 NBA Draft Class, rookies and autographs from over 13 different sets, exclusive Playoff base cards/parallels (platinum 1/1s), exclusive green parallels, green &amp; black (#/10) jersey parallels, green auto parallels, rookies of Cade Cunningham, Jalen Green, Evan Mobley, Scottie Barnes, &amp; Jalen Suggs, and more! Compared to other products, this is a low-end set. This product also has Hobby &amp; FOTL formats (exclusive cracked ice parallel #/6). You can get a box for yourself from Walmart, Target, your local sports card hobby shops, eBay, and online retailers/sellers. Overall, I would rate this product a 6/10. Good luck if you try one for yourself!<br /><br />2021 Chronicles DP Hobby review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/JBQur3aSlTM">https://youtu.be/JBQur3aSlTM</a><br />2021 Chronicles DP Blaster review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2UrruihDwpU">https://youtu.be/2UrruihDwpU</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨Become a channel member for exclusive perks, bonus videos, &amp; more:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfktPj8y08_k_NW9UdHgYOg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfktPj8y08_k_NW9UdHgYOg/join</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨Follow me on Instagram for exclusive info &amp; early news: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/packmancards">https://www.instagram.com/packmancards</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/packmanbreaks">https://www.instagram.com/packmanbreaks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/packmeetsworld">https://www.instagram.com/packmeetsworld</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨Join our community of collectors on Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/XzwBYMD2fY">https://discord.gg/XzwBYMD2fY</a><br /><br />ðŸš¨Check out my new Twitch/gaming channels:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/packmanbutgaming">https://www.twitch.tv/packmanbutgaming</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5C2LmagAfjGY6drzeSBrmg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5C2LmagAfjGY6drzeSBrmg</a><br /><br />Link to my site for group breaks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://packmansportscards.com/collections/all">https://packmansportscards.com/collections/all</a><br /><br />Check out my second channel for group breaks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://YouTube.com/c/packmanbreaks">https://YouTube.com/c/packmanbreaks</a><br /><br />Stay tuned for many more NBA &amp; NFL box breaks, product reviews, sports card unboxings, and IRL pack openings!
