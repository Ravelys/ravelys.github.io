Please be aware that Youtube will flag your upload and bring it to my attention. <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is my senior film project, which I worked on for several months in my last semester of college. It stars my sister, Lacie and shows the importance of paying attention to what children are doing online. I recently gave Lacie her phone last year, and always worry about who she's talking to online. She isn't allowed to have social media accounts yet, but when making this film I talked to her about the importance of never talking to someone she didn't know. Not everyone is who they say they are. <br /><br />Enjoy.{% endraw %}
