{% raw %}How and Why to Cite: advice from a professor for new students in the social sciences. <br /><br />This video deals with some of the more common grade-lowering mistakes and how to avoid them. <br /><br />Topics covered: <br /><br />-the real purpose of assignments <br /><br />-the big-picture significance of undergraduate courses <br /><br />-when to paraphrase vs. when to quote <br /><br />-what counts as plagiarism in post-secondary studies, and how to avoid it <br /><br />-writing for your audience: making your work relevant your course <br /><br />...and some more advanced tips at the end.<br /><br />STUDENTS: these are general guidelines and principles that I hope will help you. They're also &quot;the rules&quot; in my classes,  but if you're not in my classes, always ask your instructor about their rules re: style, formatting, etc.<br /> <br />PROFS / TAs / TEACHERS - feel free to show clips or assign any of my videos in your classes. No need to ask permission, but feel free to send any feedback. Thanks!{% endraw %}
