{% raw %}As a lifelong world wanderer, Joseph Campbell has a particular perspective on advocacy and self-determination. When your race is a barrier at home and an advantage abroad, why would you not choose to migrate somewhere else? But once you do, must you speak on behalf of those disenfranchised in your home country or adopted homeland? <br /> Joseph Campbell migrated from the United States to Adelaide, a simple process that involved a bit of paperwork. The reality turned out to be a bit more complicated. Ten years as an expat from Chile to Malawi to Adelaide has him now wondering about our place in the world as advocates. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
