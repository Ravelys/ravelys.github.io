{% raw %}Free food is a wonderful thing. I remember strolling the aisles in different stores as a kid, searching for any and every free sample I could possibly find.  Think Costco, Sam's Club, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Ikea and more. Nowadays, free food is much harder to come by. Perhaps it's due to COVID. Or too many people taking advantage. But today, we brought free samples back in the best way possible. Because we did it with caviar. <br /><br />Everybody has heard the term caviar. But most people seem to have absolutely no idea what it is. Caviar is salt-cured fish roe (eggs). You've probably seen other fish eggs before (salmon, flying fish, etc) on things like sushi and more, but these are not considered caviar. Caviar solely comes from a very large fish called the sturgeon. In this video, we've handed out 50 tins of Royal Ossetra caviar, the best-of-the-best. I absolutely loved making this video and I want to send a huge thank you to everybody who agreed to be featured in this vid! <br /><br />This video was not sponsored (I have to tell you if that's the case) but Imperia Caviar did generously provide the caviar for me to hand out. While the tins we handed out could each individually retail for over $700 dollars, Imperia has the same (if not better) quality and charges closer to $45 for this same exact tin. So, if you're curious to try some, here's a link with an additional 10 percent off!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33OQdEp">https://bit.ly/33OQdEp</a> <br /><br />Caviar is for everybody. The same way anyone can cook, anyone can eat caviar. Even my hamster Pesto. Let me know what you want me to hand out next, and get excited for the TWO MILLION SUBSCRIBER special video next Wednesday. There's something pretty exciting in there...<br /><br />FOLLOW ME:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nick.digiovanni/">https://www.instagram.com/nick.digiovanni/</a><br />Tik Tok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nick.digiovanni">https://www.tiktok.com/@nick.digiovanni</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chefnickdigi">https://twitter.com/chefnickdigi</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chefnickdigi">https://www.facebook.com/chefnickdigi</a><br /><br />#caviar #sturgeon #freefood #ossetra #royalossetra #beluga #recipe #cooking #yummy #cook #cooking #foodie #food #chef{% endraw %}
