{% raw %}This video shows how to address converting a vector file with a placed photo element inside, that needs to be under based with white, but the element is not selectable in order to apply a choke. We take it into a raster (photoshop) file to create a quick and accurate base with a choke.<br /><br />This particular tutorial is not about &quot;what is the most efficient method”, (as there are other more obvious methods) such as re-drawing the element but that’s a different video. Each image will be more or less complex. For the simple ones, you can take a few minutes to re-draw or even auto trace. Depending not he image quality, auto trace may not be the best method. A sure fire way to achieve a very accurate reproduction is to take the image into photoshop at 600ppi. Re-drawing simple items would be the obvious method (again, for this simple art) but is not what this vid is intended for. This vid illustrates a method for taking a vector file (and photo image) into photoshop all as one piece, and adjusting there to choke your base. You cannot choke a photo in vector.{% endraw %}
