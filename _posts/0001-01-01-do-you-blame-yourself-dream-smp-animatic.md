{% raw %}uh oh Ranboo<br /><br />Audio is from LUCIDS: PART THREE -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/W7l5AOOqNyQ">https://youtu.be/W7l5AOOqNyQ</a><br />I know people have done similar animatics with Ranboo and this audio but I really thought putting it into the prison context would be cool so please enjoy the video <br /><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nerd_colourmix">https://twitter.com/nerd_colourmix</a><br /><br /><br />An Animatic I made for the DREAM SMP lore. If you’re confused it’s based on Ranboo’s story arc and how Ranboo is a traitor and might break Dream out of prison. RANBOO IS MINING INTO THE PRISON TO BREAK DREAM OUT THEORY, WHAT? Yes. Pandora’s vault is very spooky and it’s inescapable and awesamdude is the warden. Apparently if there’s any breach in the prison awesamdude gets a text message? WILD. Awesamdude’s gonna manhunt Ranboo. Dream smp is a very cool Minecraft server with lots of cool lore and I made an animatic (art) for it :){% endraw %}
