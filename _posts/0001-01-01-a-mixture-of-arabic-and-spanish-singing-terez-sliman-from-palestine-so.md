{% raw %}The name of the song is Ya talêel al-jabal. At the beginning of the century, while Palestine was a British mandate, it was said by women for insurgents. They approached the dungeon walls and sang this song with the words &quot;it will gain resistance, it will come and save you&quot;. The song began to be sung for prisoners in Israeli dungeons too long afterwards, and an extra &quot;lê&quot; syllable was inserted between the words so that the invaders who knew halfway Arabic could not understand it. In the song, Terez Sliman was accompanied by Sofia Adriana (Portugal). Ritmo de Panaderas, the dough kneading rhythm of Spanish women, made a mix. They showed that the feeling and culture of women is a universal common language. In Spanish, panadería means baker. It is a traditional Spanish song that women sing during the cooking process. Hand movement while rhythm was the process of making bread dough{% endraw %}
