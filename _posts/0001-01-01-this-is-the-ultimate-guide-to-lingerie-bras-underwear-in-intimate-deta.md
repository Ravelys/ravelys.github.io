{% raw %}&quot;In Intimate Detail&quot; by Cora Harrington: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thelingerieaddict.com/in-intimate-detail">https://www.thelingerieaddict.com/in-intimate-detail</a><br /><br />Cora Harrington's &quot;In Intimate Detail&quot; is an easy to read guide to Lingerie, how to buy it, and how to store it. The book covers topics like Bras, Underwear, Shapewear, Hosiery, &amp; Loungewear in a way that explains each topic's history, what body types and shapes they will benefit, beautiful illustrations to train the eye for garment identification, and tips and tricks along the way. I initially picked up the book because I was looking for a guide to Lingerie to help me with my Victoria Secret Fashion Show videos, but the book is so much more than just a guide to garments, it truly feels like a book that actually walks the reader through how to identify different aspects of their body and what Lingerie might work well for them. It talks about fibers and fabrics and how putting certain things on your body can affect it. There are guides to storage as well as care, which is important for those looking to take care of their lingerie, in order to have it last longer. There are even tips for how to purchase, custom, new, and vintage lingerie, as well as guides on how to shop in person for it, as well as online! I couldn't even cover all the topics Cora Harrington discusses, which is why I think the book is a must-have for those that love fashion as well as those that have never been truly taught what is the right way to wear and buy Lingerie!<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join</a><br /><br />Peter Do Top: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://peterdo.net/collections/tops/products/asymmetrical-rib-knit-tank?variant=31987433963617">https://peterdo.net/collections/tops/products/asymmetrical-rib-knit-tank?variant=31987433963617</a><br /><br />Social Media:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/</a><br />Personal Style: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess">https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess</a><br /><br />For business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@ellifyagency.com<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ujbeats/ifbeat">https://soundcloud.com/ujbeats/ifbeat</a><br /><br />Video Edited by:<br />Rachel Fritz: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/">https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/</a>{% endraw %}
