{% raw %}This video is finally my good answer to all the people asking me about a quality alto trombone that doesn't cost too much.<br /><br />If you want to try learning to play alto, you probably don't want to throw $4,000 at the experiment! I bought the cheapest alto trombone I could find on eBay and within this video I talk about it and record a comparison between it and my Yamaha YSL671. I also recorded a tuning test to see how accurately it plays.<br /><br />It's called a Moz.{% endraw %}
