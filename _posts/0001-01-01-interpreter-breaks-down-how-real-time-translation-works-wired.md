{% raw %}Conference interpreter Barry Slaughter Olsen explains what it's really like to be a professional interpreter. Barry goes behind the scenes of his vocation, breaking down the many real-life scenarios he faces on a day-to-day basis. From simultaneous and consecutive interpretation to chuchotage and décalage, take a peek behind what it really takes to be a professional interpreter. <br /><br /><br /><br />Barry Slaughter Olsen is the Professor of Translation and Interpretation at Middlebury Institute of International Studies. <br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE: The techniques employed in this video are not all applicable to interpreting in a courtroom setting, where expectations regarding accuracy and completeness can be quite different. In this sense, legal interpreting is unique.
