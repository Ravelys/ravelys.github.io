{% raw %}A huge tornado was filmed on Saturday 2 October in the commune of Il-Rous in Corsica. A giant pillar circled over the sea next to the cruise ships and almost came close to the shore.<br />A giant crater several tens of meters high circled in relative proximity to the coast and came close to cruise liners. Despite what is happening, eyewitnesses admired the natural phenomenon. Soon the funnel disappeared into the sky without a trace.<br />#weather #news #sky #hail #France #rain #Corsica #Il-Rus #flood #tornado #earthquake #lightning #hurricane #nature #disasters<br />The channel lists natural disasters, such as: 1) Geological emergencies: earthquake, volcanic eruption, mud, landslide, landslide, avalanche; 2) Emergency hydrological situations: tsunami, limnological disaster, flood; 3) Fires: forest fire, peat fire; 4) Meteorological emergencies: Tornado, Cyclone, Blizzard, Hail, Drought, Tornado, Hail, Hurricane, Tsunami, Storm, Thunderstorm, Storm.<br />playlist NATURAL DISASTERS https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v = 8bHtC ...{% endraw %}
