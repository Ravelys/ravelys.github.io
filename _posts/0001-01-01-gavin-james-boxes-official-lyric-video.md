It‚Äôs an anti ‚Äúfit in‚Äù song. All about not letting people put you in a box. üì¶ It‚Äôs about following your dreams and not listening to all the people telling you along the way that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not good enough‚Äù or ‚Äúyou will never do it‚Äù. It‚Äôs about believing in yourself.<br />So this video starts off in a classroom with lil ginger me as I drift off to a mad dreamland that takes me all over the üåç ‚ù§Ô∏è <br />Hope you like it x<br /><br />Follow on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GJfollow">http://bit.ly/GJfollow</a> <br />Sign up to my mailing list now to be the first to get exclusive pre-sale tickets + VIP experiences!!üòÄ üôåüèº <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://GavinJames.lnk.to/MailingList">https://GavinJames.lnk.to/MailingList</a> <br />Like on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/gavinjamesmusic">http://www.facebook.com/gavinjamesmusic</a> <br />Follow on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/gavinjameslive">http://instagram.com/gavinjameslive</a> <br />Follow on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/gavinjames">http://twitter.com/gavinjames</a> <br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://gavinjamesmusic.com/">http://gavinjamesmusic.com/</a> <br /><br />Director - Ivan Dixon &amp; Sean Zwan<br />Producer - Sean Zwan &amp; Ivan Dixon<br />Production company - Studio Showoff<br /><br />GAVIN JAMES - BOXES LYRICS<br />Went to the wrong school<br />Wearing the wrong shoes<br />They told me that I should just sit down and just bite my tongue<br />Coz if you're lucky <br />You'll get to university<br />Say three hail Marys <br />And everything bad will be gone<br /> <br />But I'm so tired of standing still<br />And I'm not buying what you're trying to sell<br /> <br />So don't wake me up,<br />If you're only going to tell me to give it up<br />Then say everything I do is never enough<br />Coz you're lying through your teeth<br />We don't fit into your boxes<br />We're all different underneath <br />Don't wake me up<br /> <br />When I got my first guitar<br />My father told me son,<br />Four chords is all you need to show people just who you are,<br />So I played to strangers<br />Down by the backstreets<br />And everytime they caught me dreaming I'd say<br /> <br />Don't wake me up<br />If you're only going to tell me to give it up<br />Then say everything i do is never enough<br />Coz you're lying through your teeth<br />We don't fit into your boxes<br />We‚Äôre all different underneath <br /> <br />Don't wake me up<br /> <br />Don't wake me up<br /> <br />Coz I'm so tired of standing still<br />And I'm not buying what you are trying to sell<br />So don't wake me up<br /> <br />Oh, don't wake me up<br /> <br />If you're only going to tell me to give it up<br />Then say everything I do is never enough<br />Coz you're lying through your teeth<br />We don't' fit into your boxes<br />We‚Äôre all different underneath <br /> <br />Don't wake me up<br />Don't wake me up<br />Don't wake me up<br />Don't wake me up<br /><br />#GavinJames #Boxes #OfficialLyricVideo{% endraw %}
