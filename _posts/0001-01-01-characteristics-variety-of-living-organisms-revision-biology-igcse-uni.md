I am learning technology as I go along, through 'lockdown' due to Covid-19. I never thought I would end up doing YouTube videos, but seeming as I am recording lessons, as well as doing live lessons with my pupils, I thought I should try putting them onto YouTube to see if they could help other pupils and teachers too.<br />If you enjoyed what you watched why not click the like button and  if you want to watch more why not subscribe.<br />#cricksbiology<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cricksbiology.wixsite.com/website">https://cricksbiology.wixsite.com/website</a>{% endraw %}
