{% raw %}You can almost stay lazy for this workout! :D No squats, no sweat, no standing up ♥️ / Werbung <br /><br />This routine targets the inner part of the top of your legs = the INNER THIGHS. <br /><br />▸ You might think they are a bit wobbly &amp; hard to target during normal leg days. That’s normal!! It’s a small muscle that is usually secondary. <br />▸ With slow and concentrated exercises, we can wake up those muscles &amp; make them more tight and toned :) <br />▸ You will also train them more effectively, if you continue with additional leg workouts afterwards. <br />▸ This also works amazing as a „finisher“ after your leg day. To make sure those inner thighs will be soooore tomorrow! <br /><br />PS: I filmed this workout completely on my own! My mind was busy with „s**t I hope the focus is still correct“ &amp; „its so windy I cannot hear the beep“ :D :D the video turned out nice though, lucky me!! <br />__<br /><br />➞ my Pam App ♥️ Free workout plans (8 versions), lot of recipes &amp; tips: <br />H<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="ttps://www.pam-app.de/app">ttps://www.pam-app.de/app</a><br /><br />▸ 3 of those FREE WORKOUT PLANS are on my Instagram Channel. <br />30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly.
