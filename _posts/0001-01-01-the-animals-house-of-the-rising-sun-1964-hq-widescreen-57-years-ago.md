{% raw %}January 29, 2021. Very sad news that legendary guitarist with The Animals HILTON VALENTINE has died. What can you say about this man who gave us so much in the world of rock n roll... it's hard to summarise but he was a beautiful, great, influential guitarist who blessed us with his talent and flair with so many unforgettable and legendary performances. Chuck Berry (!) once described Hilton Valentine as &quot;a wildly exciting instrumentalist&quot;.  Absolutely! there was so much more to Hilton than House of the Rising Sun,  just check out Hilton's many other performances on album tracks and live performances and you would soon hear why Chuck Berry would acknowledge Hilton in this way. Hilton, we loved and admired you and forevermore thank you for all your beautiful contributions to rock n roll and for your presence. Rest in Peace and Love Forever!<br /><br />HILTON VALENTINE,  May 21, 1943 - January 29, 2021. ✿ܓ<br /><br />ERIC BURDON has paid tribute to his fellow band member - 'The opening opus of Rising Sun will never sound the same!... You didn’t just play it, you lived it! Heartbroken by the sudden news of Hilton’s passing. We had great times together, Geordie lad. From the North Shields to the entire world...Rock In Peace'<br /><br />Remembering Hilton Valentine by ABKCO Music &amp; Records:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abkco.com/news-feed/remembering-hilton-valentine/">https://www.abkco.com/news-feed/remembering-hilton-valentine/</a><br /><br />Brian May of Queen pays tribute to Hilton (and The Animals) in these clips:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKvIiKoByHR/">https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKvIiKoByHR/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1_PS6XdHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1_PS6XdHs</a><br /><br />Tribute piece to Hilton on ITV News Tyne Tees: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/itvtynetees/videos/168802408373040/">https://www.facebook.com/itvtynetees/videos/168802408373040/</a><br /><br />November 16, 2021 - A blue plaque celebrating the life of guitar legend, Hilton Valentine has been placed on the wall at his childhood home in North Shields:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gerrylooknorth/status/1460697796990930949">https://twitter.com/gerrylooknorth/status/1460697796990930949</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2021-11-12/blue-plaque-tribute-for-north-shields-guitar-legend-hilton-valentine">https://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2021-11-12/blue-plaque-tribute-for-north-shields-guitar-legend-hilton-valentine</a><br /><br />Rest in peace Hilton Valentine, you live on forever in our hearts. ✿ܓ<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmcbCJ54E78">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmcbCJ54E78</a><br />RIVER TYNE by Hilton Valentine<br /><br />✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ✿ܓ<br /><br />♥♫ JULY 2021 - 57 YEARS AGO this month (in 1964), The Animals' ground-breaking and legendary single 'House of the Rising Sun' reaches #1 position in the UK charts.
