{% raw %}I have learnt so much over the last few years building my business, scaling brands, hiring a team of 50+ …<br />&amp; so I created a series right here on YouTube, showing behind the scenes of my startup, real conversations, real meetings &amp; sharing the lessons I’ve learned along the way.<br /><br />I saw a lot of comments recently asking about how I built my company &amp; how I got to where I am today, so I thought it was worth siting down &amp; sharing a bit of my story / my entrepreneurial journey 👊🏽<br /><br />Let me know in the comments what you’d like to see more of / if you have any questions 👇<br /><br />--<br />My Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shan.hanif/">https://www.instagram.com/shan.hanif/</a><br />Genflow's Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/genflow_/">https://www.instagram.com/genflow_/</a><br /><br />Genflow: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://genflow.com/">https://genflow.com/</a>{% endraw %}
