{% raw %}This video will show you the general principles on how your port will be cared for, but is not intended to teach you how to access your port.<br /><br />All healthcare providers, usually a nurse, who access or insert the needle into the port have been trained on the sterile technique and proper care.  However, there may be subtle differences in how they do this.  It is important that you know how the catheter should be cared for.  It is also important that you speak up if something seems different from usual.{% endraw %}
