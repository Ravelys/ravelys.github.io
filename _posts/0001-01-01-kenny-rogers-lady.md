(C) 1980<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you<br />You have made me what I am and I am yours<br />My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you<br />Let me hold you in my arms forever more<br /><br />You have gone and made me such a fool<br />I'm so lost in your love<br />And oh, we belong together<br />Won't you believe in my song<br /><br />Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you<br />You have come into my life and made me whole<br />Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning<br />Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear<br /><br />In my eyes I see no one else but you<br />There's no other love like our love<br />And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me<br />I've waited for you for so long<br /><br />Lady, your love's the only love I need<br />And beside me is where I want you to be<br />'Cause, my love, there's something I want you to know<br />You're the love of my life, you're my lady<br /><br />#KennyRogers #Lady{% endraw %}
