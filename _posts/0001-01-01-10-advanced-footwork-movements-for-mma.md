{% raw %}Training Vacation in Singapore►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/FightTIPSinSingapore">http://bit.ly/FightTIPSinSingapore</a><br />Hey guys, Shane here with 10 MMA footwork movements taken from different martial arts styles including Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, and Boxing. Balance is key, so make sure your weight is evenly distributed between both legs; keep your shoulders level; and practice these movements daily in your shadowboxing! <br /><br />I am beyond excited for this training vacation at Evolve MMA in Singapore, and hope to see you there! If you've been wanting to train at a legit' fight camp in Asia, this is the one to go to. I trained with Petchboonchu, Kru Rong, Orono, Bruno Pucci, and more world-class trainers earlier this year at Evolve, and had such an incredible experience. Everyone is so friendly, making you feel welcome and comfortable, and their knowledge &amp; instruction is of the highest quality. See you in August?<br />Train with me &amp; the legends►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/FightTIPSinSingapore">http://bit.ly/FightTIPSinSingapore</a><br /><br />Subscribe to fightTIPS►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1APnzvw">http://bit.ly/1APnzvw</a><br /><br />FOLLOW:<br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/fightTIPSFacebook">http://bit.ly/fightTIPSFacebook</a><br />Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/fightTIPSTwitter">http://bit.ly/fightTIPSTwitter</a><br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/fightTIPSInstagram">http://bit.ly/fightTIPSInstagram</a>{% endraw %}
