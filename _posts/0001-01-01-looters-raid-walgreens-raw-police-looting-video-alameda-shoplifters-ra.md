{% raw %}This RAW police looting video shows a group of shop lifting looters raiding a Walgreens drug store in Alameda, CA. This was not their first time and they've raided this store and others in the area. Just watch the way these thieves steal merchandise without fear. In this video I explain why security can't stop brazen looting like this Alameda shoplift anymore.<br /><br />UPDATE: This problem is getting bad enough to close more of these stores. Here's the link to the story <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Another-San-Francisco-Walgreens-is-closing-15659279.php">https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Another-San-Francisco-Walgreens-is-closing-15659279.php</a>{% endraw %}
