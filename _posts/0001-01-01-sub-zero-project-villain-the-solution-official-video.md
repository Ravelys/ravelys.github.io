And with a video clip to really drool over, The Solution is just one of those Hardstyle tracks you can't help but indulge in its brutal beauty.<br /><br />Enjoy the brand new video clip, this is Sub Zero Project &amp; Villain - The Solution.<br /><br />Dirty Workz is the Worlds leading Hardstyle label. With a broad sound, representing World leading Hardstyle artists, supporting the rising stars in the Hardstyle scene as well as the darker sounds of Raw under the Anarchy Hardstyle imprint to the fresh new combination of sounds which is Wolf Clan and the faster party sounds of Electric Fox - Dirty Workz has it all!<br /><br />#Hardstyle #DirtyWorkz #TheSolution{% endraw %}
