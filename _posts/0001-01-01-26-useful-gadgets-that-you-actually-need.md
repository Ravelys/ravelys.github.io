Picking up after your dog when you go out on walks can be tricky and gross, but we have the perfect solution—dog diapers!<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />1:21 – Solar-powered car fan<br />4:12 – Portable handsaw<br />6:28 – Cat brush glove<br />9:50 – Dog diapers<br />10:23 – Inflatable clothes hanger<br /><br />We advise adult supervision and care at all times.<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
