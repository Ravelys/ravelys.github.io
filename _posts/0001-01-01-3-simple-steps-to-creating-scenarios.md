And too many Learning Experience Designers are confused about what to do because they don't really have any systems or processes in place. <br /><br />ABOUT THIS VIDEO:<br /><br />In this short video, I outline a simple three step process for designing scenarios.<br /><br />Here's a rundown:<br /><br />First, you start with some focusing questions, pick a framework, and gather relevant info from an internal expert. (In a nutshell, step one is about getting your head right and tuning your creativity to the right frequency.)<br /><br />Step two of scenario design is about producing a detailed outline, an interactive outline (choice moments, branching, etc.) and then, finally, a script of the experience.<br /><br />The third step can be pretty easy. This is where you'll focus on visual communication and look and feel. I say this is pretty easy because a) more talented graphic designers are entering learning design and b) current software solutions are baking design elements into their solutions.<br /><br />Check out the video and let me know what you think in the comments section below?<br /><br />Here's the link to the full video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://annasabramowicz.com/3-simple-steps-to-creating-scenarios/">https://annasabramowicz.com/3-simple-steps-to-creating-scenarios/</a><br /><br />HERE'S WHAT WE COVER:<br /><br />1. Why it's important to start seeing the forest for the trees<br /><br />2. No need for needs analysis (which is mostly verbal hobby nonsense imho)<br /><br />3.

Tips to choosing best person to be your Subject Matter Expert (Hint: It's not you.)<br /><br />6. Why your SME interview is you 'Lead Domino'<br /><br />7. What you should steal from the comic book and movie industry<br /><br />8.
