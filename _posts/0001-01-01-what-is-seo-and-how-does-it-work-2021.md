This would be a part of on-page SEO where you have a keyword for what you are attempting to cover, alt and title tags as well as descriptions for your images, linking to similar articles on your site that may be useful.<br /><br />If you liked this video, then please Like and consider subscribing to our channel here for more WordPress videos.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=wpbeginner">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=wpbeginner</a><br /><br />--- Related Content ---<br /><br />-WordPress Tutorial [UPDATED] - How to Make a WordPress Website for Beginners <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvbFBxKcORA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvbFBxKcORA</a><br /><br />Check us out on Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/wpbeginner">https://www.facebook.com/wpbeginner</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/wpbeginner">http://twitter.com/wpbeginner</a><br /><br />Check out our website for more WordPress Tutorials<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com">http://www.wpbeginner.com</a><br />#WordPress #WordPressTutorial #WPBeginner{% endraw %}
