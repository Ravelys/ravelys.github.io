{% raw %}&quot;Featuring the two-keyboard, two-guitar, two-drummer, one-bass Grateful Dead lineup, this magnificent, soaring Help/Slip/Franklin's is one of the best of the late-era returns of this trio. In the lineup 1975-1977, 1983-1985, and 1989-1995, this enigmatic addition to the repertoire is one of the most dynamic and ambitious song cycles the Dead ever wrote and performed. From the Summer Tour of 1991 that also featured great shows at Deer Creek, Giants Stadium, Chicago, and Pine Knob, among others, this was the second release in the View From The Vault series.&quot; - David Lemieux<br /><br />Subscribe! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Rhino.lnk.to/GratefulDeadYTSubID">https://Rhino.lnk.to/GratefulDeadYTSubID</a><br /><br />Take a trip with our playlists....<br /><br />The Grateful Dead Fundamentals <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDead101ID">https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDead101ID</a><br />Legendary Live Cuts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDeadAYTLiveID">https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDeadAYTLiveID</a><br />The Dead: Covered <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDeadCoveredID">https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDeadCoveredID</a><br />Scintillating Bust Outs <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDeadBustOutsID">https://Rhino.lnk.to/YTGratefulDeadBustOutsID</a><br /><br />Stay connected with The Dead on...<br /><br />dead.net <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dead.net/">http://www.dead.net/</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/gratefuldead/">https://www.facebook.com/gratefuldead/</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gratefuldead">https://www.instagram.com/gratefuldead</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GratefulDead">https://twitter.com/GratefulDead</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Will you come with me?
