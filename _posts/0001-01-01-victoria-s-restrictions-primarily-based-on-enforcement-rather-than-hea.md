{% raw %}Victoria’s lockdown restrictions seem to be based on the “ease of police enforcing” rather than on allowing people to live their lives or on health principles, according to The Australian’s Rachel Baxendale.<br /><br />Premier Daniel Andrews recently clashed over mandatory face masks for regional Victorians with Ms Baxendale who asked him to explain the necessity of the measure for somebody who is simply walking by themselves.<br /><br />“Seriously what’s the issue? Why is it such a massive issue?” the premier said.<br /><br />“That’s an esoteric debate really isn’t it? Maybe there’ll be a time where we have the luxury of having those sorts of debates”.<br /><br />Ms Baxendale told Sky News host Chris Kenny whether it be regional Victorians or Melburnians, people can be trusted to decide “whether or not they’re in close proximity” with others.<br /><br />“But if they’re not, if they’re fishing by themselves or going for a walk by themselves, I think it’s draconian and unnecessary for them to be asked to wear masks,” she said.<br /><br />“It does really seem that these rules are based on the lowest common denominator, and based on the ease of police enforcing the rules rather than the ease of people living their lives, and rather than based on health principles.<br /><br />“They seem to be based primarily on enforcement rather than on health and biology.”{% endraw %}
