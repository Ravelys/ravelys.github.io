{% raw %}It's 1am, the rain is clearing and a dry line has just begun to form. You dodge puddles in the moonlight, staying clear of the slippery curbs and painted lines. Slower traffic acts as moving chicanes lap after lap, putting you on to sub-optimal lines through the corners, testing your handling and car control. The sun begins to rise over the mountains and your vision slowly increases. You make your final pit stop of the race and set out to catch the leaders of your class with only minutes remaining.<br /><br />Not many sims can pull off convincing endurances races, but I think I've discovered my favorite way to enjoy Automobilista 2. The environmental conditions truly shine and show off some of the best depictions of track dynamics in any sim. The fact that the AI are reasonable at almost any circuit, and pair it with the excellent handing BMW 2002 Turbo, this is a combination that keeps me coming back and keeps it exciting. No two races are the same!<br /><br />Email - gplaps67@gmail.com<br />Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/v4K9HBpZv8">https://discord.gg/v4K9HBpZv8</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gplapsjake">https://twitter.com/gplapsjake</a><br /><br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:59 Car Info<br />3:35 Race Settings<br />11:39 Track Info<br />13:20 Race - Stint 1<br />33:05 Race - Stint 2<br />53:12 Race - Stint 3<br />1:14:22 Final Thoughts{% endraw %}
