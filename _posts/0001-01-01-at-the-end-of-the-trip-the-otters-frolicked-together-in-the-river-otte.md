{% raw %}It makes me happy to see Aty and Ui happily playing together in the river.<br />I guess there used to be a lot of otters in these common rivers all over Japan.<br />There are many more places I want to visit in Gunma, so we will come back again sometime.<br /><br />Due to the effects of COVID-19, I am currently working only with certain friends.<br />In order to avoid contact with a large number of people, we have chosen a place with as few people as possible and avoid contact with people other than our friends.<br />If you see us, we would appreciate it if you could avoid contact with us and watch over us from a distance.<br /><br />★Who is Omichan &amp; Lynn-san?<br />Lynn-san is a model and Instagrammer who loves camping.
