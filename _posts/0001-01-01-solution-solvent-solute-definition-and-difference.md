The substance that dissolves in water is table salt. Salt is a solute in this case and it dissolves in water to form a saltwater (a solvent) solution.<br /><br />In this science video, cartoon character gives a very simple definition as well as show several experiments. To your surprise, thereâ€™s a magician also in this video who shows scientific tricks in this video.{% endraw %}
