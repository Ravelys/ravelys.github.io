{% raw %}Autumn themed soap making with soothing musicüéµ<br /><br />In September all the trees, bushes and plants were still green and the rowan trees started glowing with red ripening berries. <br /><br />The birds seem to really like the berries. One day there were so many birds flying around a big rowan tree I thought they were having a party :)<br /><br />I thought I could make use of the berries in a soap somehow and in this video I show you what I came up with.<br /><br />By now the weather has gotten a lot cooler and the rowan trees have shed their leaves, but the vibrant berries are still decorating the branches.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Please wear proper safety equipment when making soap.<br /><br />Rowan berry soap recipe:<br /><br />Recipe calculated with: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soapee.com/calculator">https://soapee.com/calculator</a><br /><br />Oils:<br />200 g olive oil (40%)<br />150 g coconut oil (30%)<br />100 g shea butter (20%)<br />50 g castor oil (10%)<br /><br />Frozen rowan berry infusion 160 g<br /><br />10 g citric acid + a splash of distilled water<br /><br />Sodium hydroxide lye:<br />when adding citric acid: 76 g<br />without citric acid: 70 g<br /><br />(30.3 % lye concentration, 5% superfat)<br /><br />Sprinkle of dried rowan berries<br />1 tbsp madder root dispersed in olive oil<br />9 g essential oils<br /><br />Cure the soap for about 4 weeks before using on your skin.<br /><br />‚óã Citric acid information<br /><br />When citric acid and sodium hydroxide lye (NaOH) are combined, sodium citrate is created. Sodium citrate works as a chelator in soap.<br /><br />A chelator traps metal ions such as calcium and magnesium that can be found in tap water.<br /><br />These metal contaminants can cause rancidity and soap scum in handmade soap.<br /><br />A chelator binds to these metals so that they can‚Äôt bind to the soap molecules. This way the soap won‚Äôt react with them and the soap's lather improves + shelf life increases.<br /><br />Citric acid does not lower the pH of soap. Instead it consumes some of the lye and increases the superfat. Add 6 g extra lye for every 10 g of citric acid added to a soap recipe if you want to keep the superfat % at the same level.<br /><br />How much citric acid should be added to soap?<br /><br />Usage rate in bar soap is 1-2% of the oil weight.<br /><br />How to use citric acid<br /><br />Add citric acid to the distilled water and dissolve completely before adding the lye, or make a separate solution of citric acid and distilled water and add to the oils.<br /><br />Soap making equipment*<br /><br />‚óã Safety glasses - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pP99gz">https://amzn.to/3pP99gz</a><br />‚óã Gloves - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gjEViA">https://amzn.to/3gjEViA</a><br />‚óã Braun multiquick stick blender (black colored version) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35h3GFO">https://amzn.to/35h3GFO</a><br />‚óã Infrared thermometer - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fXLx6e">https://amzn.to/3fXLx6e</a><br />‚óã Digital scale - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zmJSOR">https://amzn.to/3zmJSOR</a><br />‚óã High precision scale - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39YRc8t">https://amzn.to/39YRc8t</a><br />‚óã Spatulas - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zo8DdB">https://amzn.to/3zo8DdB</a><br />‚óã Funnel pitchers for easy pouring - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aYb9h1">https://amzn.to/3aYb9h1</a><br />‚óã Silicone molds:<br />‚óã Single cavity mold - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cAEIW0">https://amzn.to/3cAEIW0</a><br />‚óã Silicone loaf mold - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35gS05S">https://amzn.to/35gS05S</a><br />‚óã Small wooden soap mold with silicone lining - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pVdn6b">https://amzn.to/3pVdn6b</a><br />‚óã Cafe de savon wire cutter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3090601/">https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3090601/</a><br />‚óã Guide - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3081202/">https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3081202/</a><br />‚óã Swiss star stainless steel vegetable peeler for beveling soaps - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ak4VHW">https://amzn.to/3ak4VHW</a><br />‚óã Mini mixer - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35dvECc">https://amzn.to/35dvECc</a><br /><br />Recommended reading:<br /><br />‚óã <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iIllh5">https://amzn.to/3iIllh5</a><br /><br />As an amazon associate I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />*amazon links are affiliate links.
