{% raw %}Today is my final day of chemotherapy! It truly felt like this day would never come. I had a total of 16 chemo treatments. In this video I document my breast cancer journey up until the point I go in for my final treatment. It was a very emotional moment for me. I'm proud of my body and the fight it has given to keep me here. This isn't the end of my breast cancer journey. Surgery, radiation and reconstruction lie ahead; but this is a landmark chapter in my fight to beat breast cancer. I'm so happy to be done with chemo. To all those going through similar journeys, I send my love and prayers. Keep up the fight!{% endraw %}
